## Overview

Beyond budgets and governance procedures, the Springfield School District 19 Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the educational programs and community engagement initiatives that define the district's mission. From curriculum standards set by the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) to partnerships with Lane Education Service District (Lane ESD), from student-centered events to educator workforce development, the board's decisions shape what students learn, how they are supported, and how the community connects with its schools.

For new board members, it is important to understand that curriculum and program decisions are not made in isolation by administrators. While the superintendent and instructional staff lead the review and selection of materials and programs, the board plays a formal governance role — approving curriculum adoptions, setting budget priorities that fund or defund programs, and ensuring that the district meets its legal obligations around special education, equity, and instructional quality. Being informed about current programs and community priorities is essential to exercising this role effectively.

Springfield SD 19 operates a range of programs that reflect both state mandates and local values. These include compliance-driven obligations like High Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) adoption and special education services, as well as community-driven initiatives like the Native American Student Union (NASU) Summit, the Future Colts recruitment program, and the Pathways educator pipeline. Each of these represents a different dimension of the board's responsibility — legal compliance, educational quality, community engagement, and workforce sustainability.

Understanding these programs in context helps board members see the full picture of what the district does and why. Decisions about any one program ripple outward: cutting a community engagement initiative may save money in the short term but erode trust and participation; investing in the teacher pipeline pays dividends over years but requires upfront commitment. The board's role is to balance these competing demands with clear eyes and informed judgment.

## Key Concepts

### High Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM)

The Oregon Department of Education requires school districts to adopt High Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) — curriculum resources that meet rigorous standards for academic content, cultural responsiveness, and alignment with Oregon's learning standards. The HQIM adoption process involves staff-led review of available materials, pilot testing in classrooms, community input, and ultimately a formal recommendation to the board for approval. The board does not select textbooks or curriculum materials directly, but it does vote to adopt them — making this a meaningful governance decision. Board members should be familiar with the HQIM framework so they can ask informed questions during adoption processes and understand the educational rationale behind staff recommendations.

### Special Education Compliance and Lane ESD Partnership

Federal and state law require school districts to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all students with disabilities, including the development and implementation of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Springfield SD 19 partners with Lane Education Service District to deliver specialized services, access expertise in areas like speech-language pathology and behavioral support, and ensure compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Special education is one of the district's most significant legal and financial obligations — it is both a moral imperative and a compliance requirement. Board members should understand that special education funding often does not fully cover the cost of services, creating a structural budget pressure that interacts with the broader fiscal challenges the district faces.

### Native American Student Union (NASU) Summit

On February 19, 2026, Springfield SD 19 hosted the Native American Student Union (NASU) Summit at Willamalane, bringing together more than 70 students for a day of cultural programming, leadership development, and community building. Events like the NASU Summit reflect the district's commitment to serving its diverse student population and honoring the identities and histories of Native American students and families. For the board, supporting these programs is both an equity priority and a community engagement strategy — it signals that the district values all students and is willing to invest time and resources in culturally responsive programming.

### Future Colts Program

The Future Colts program is a student recruitment and community engagement initiative designed to build connections with families before their children enter Springfield schools. By reaching out to prospective families, hosting events, and showcasing the district's programs and culture, Future Colts helps sustain enrollment — which, under Oregon's ADMw funding model, directly supports district revenue. The program also serves a community-building function, creating positive touchpoints between families and the district and helping new residents feel welcomed and informed.

### Pathways Program — Educator Pipeline

Teacher recruitment and retention are among the most persistent challenges facing Oregon school districts. Springfield SD 19 addresses this through the Pathways Program, a partnership with Lane ESD designed to grow and develop local teaching talent. The Pathways model encourages community members — including classified staff, paraprofessionals, and other non-certified employees — to pursue teaching credentials with support from the district and ESD. This "grow your own" approach helps build a workforce that reflects the community it serves, reduces reliance on external recruitment, and strengthens long-term staffing stability. Board members should recognize the Pathways Program as a strategic investment in the district's human capital and a response to statewide educator shortages.
