## Overview

Curriculum, programs, and community priorities sit at the heart of why school districts exist — to educate students. Yet for many new board members, the intersection of instructional programs, state standards, community expectations, and board authority is one of the most confusing and politically charged areas of governance. The board has real authority over curriculum and programs, but that authority is **policy-level**, not operational. Understanding where the board's role begins and ends is essential to being effective — and to avoiding the kind of micromanagement that undermines superintendent authority and damages board-administration relationships.

This module covers Springfield Public Schools' instructional landscape in depth: the board's legal authority, the Oregon curriculum adoption process, current programs and priorities, student outcomes, community engagement, and how board members should navigate the inevitable controversies that arise around what and how students are taught.

---

### The Board's Role in Curriculum — Governance Authority

Oregon law gives school boards explicit authority over curriculum and instructional programs:

- **ORS 332.075** — Grants the board general authority to manage and control the affairs of the district, including the course of study.
- **ORS 336.035** — Requires each district school board to adopt a course of study for the schools in the district and to prescribe the instructional materials to be used.
- **ORS 337.050–337.120** — Governs the adoption of instructional materials, including the requirement for instructional materials adoption committees.

However, board authority over curriculum operates at the **policy level**:

| Board Authority (Governance) | Superintendent Authority (Management) |
|---|---|
| Adopt the course of study (which subjects are offered) | Select specific instructional methods and strategies |
| Approve instructional materials adoptions | Recommend materials through the adoption committee process |
| Set graduation requirements (above state minimums) | Implement graduation requirements |
| Establish curriculum-related policies | Manage day-to-day instruction |
| Hear curriculum-related appeals from parents | Respond to individual parent curriculum concerns |
| Approve new programs (CTE, dual language, etc.) | Design and implement program details |
| Set expectations for student outcomes | Develop strategies to improve outcomes |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes attempt to dictate specific instructional methods, select or reject individual textbooks, or direct teachers on how to teach. This crosses the governance–management line and violates the principle of delegated authority. The board sets the "what" and "why"; the superintendent and staff determine the "how."

---

### Oregon Curriculum Adoption Process

Oregon has a structured process for curriculum and instructional materials adoption:

#### State Standards

The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) establishes academic content standards that all districts must address:

- **English Language Arts (ELA):** Based on Oregon's ELA standards (aligned with Common Core State Standards)
- **Mathematics:** Oregon math standards (Common Core-aligned)
- **Science:** Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), adopted by Oregon in 2014
- **Social Studies:** Oregon social science standards, last revised in 2018 with emphasis on ethnic studies and diverse perspectives (per HB 2845, 2017, and HB 2023, 2021)
- **Health Education:** Comprehensive health education standards, including the Comprehensive Sexuality Education requirements under ORS 336.455
- **Physical Education:** State PE standards
- **Arts:** Visual and performing arts standards
- **World Languages:** Standards for world language instruction

Districts must teach **to** the standards but have discretion in **how** they do so and which instructional materials they use.

#### Adoption Cycles

Oregon operates on a recommended **six-year adoption cycle** for core instructional materials:

| Subject Area | Most Recent Adoption Cycle | Next Adoption Due |
|---|---|---|
| English Language Arts | 2021–22 | 2027–28 |
| Mathematics | 2022–23 | 2028–29 |
| Science (NGSS) | 2019–20 | 2025–26 |
| Social Studies | 2023–24 | 2029–30 |
| Health Education | 2020–21 | 2026–27 |

*Cycles are approximate and may vary based on state guidance and district timelines.*

#### Instructional Materials Adoption Committees

Under **ORS 337.050**, districts must establish **instructional materials adoption committees** to review and recommend materials for board approval. These committees must include:

- Licensed teachers
- Administrators
- **Parents and community members** (this is a statutory requirement)
- When practicable, students

The committee reviews available materials against state standards, evaluates them for bias and accuracy, considers cost, and makes a recommendation to the superintendent, who then brings it to the board for adoption.

> 💡 **Tip:** Board members should **not** serve on instructional materials adoption committees. Your role is to approve or reject the committee's recommendation at the board level — not to participate in the selection process. Serving on the committee creates a conflict that compromises the integrity of both the committee process and the board's independent review.

### Current Instructional Priorities in Springfield

As of the most recent available data, Springfield Public Schools has identified several instructional focus areas:

#### Literacy Initiatives

Literacy is the district's top instructional priority. Springfield has invested in:

- **Structured literacy training** for elementary teachers, aligned with the "science of reading" research base
- **Early literacy screening** using tools like DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills) to identify students needing intervention by kindergarten or first grade
- **Intervention programs** such as Read Well, SIPPS, or similar programs for students below benchmark
- **Secondary literacy support** for middle and high school students reading below grade level
- Oregon's **Early Literacy Framework** (per SB 3492 / HB 3198) requires districts to implement evidence-based literacy practices

The district's literacy data shows improvement but significant gaps remain, particularly for English language learners, students with disabilities, and students experiencing poverty.

#### Mathematics

Springfield recently completed or is in the process of a **mathematics curriculum adoption** at multiple grade levels. Key considerations include:

- Alignment with Oregon math standards
- Emphasis on conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and application
- Equity of access — ensuring all students have access to grade-level mathematics
- Support for teachers transitioning to new materials (professional development, coaching)

#### Science / NGSS Implementation

Oregon adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in 2014, but full implementation has been gradual. Springfield's science instruction is transitioning to:

- Three-dimensional learning (disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts)
- Phenomenon-based instruction
- Updated laboratory and hands-on experiences
- New instructional materials aligned with NGSS

---

### CTE — Career and Technical Education

Career and Technical Education is one of Springfield's signature program areas and a high community priority.

#### What Springfield Offers

Springfield's CTE programs span multiple career clusters, typically concentrated at the high school level:

| Career Cluster | Example Programs | School Level |
|---|---|---|
| Health Sciences | Medical professions, health occupations | High School |
| Manufacturing & Engineering | Welding, machining, engineering design | High School |
| Information Technology | Computer science, digital media | High School |
| Business & Marketing | Entrepreneurship, marketing | High School |
| Agriculture & Natural Resources | Agriculture science, forestry | High School |
| Arts, A/V & Communication | Graphic design, video production | High School |
| Construction & Architecture | Building construction, drafting | High School |
| Culinary Arts & Hospitality | Culinary arts, food service | High School |
| Education & Training | Teacher cadet, early childhood | High School |
| Automotive Technology | Auto mechanics, auto body | High School |

#### Partnerships with Lane Community College (LCC)

Springfield has strong articulation agreements with **Lane Community College**, allowing students to:

- Earn **dual credit** (high school and college credit simultaneously)
- Access LCC facilities and instructors for advanced coursework
- Participate in **Career Pathways** programs that connect high school CTE to postsecondary programs
- Complete industry-recognized **certifications** before graduation (e.g., CNA, welding certifications, OSHA safety, CompTIA)

#### Industry Connections

Local industry partnerships provide:
- Internships and job shadows
- Guest speakers and mentors
- Equipment donations and sponsorships
- Advisory committee participation (required by Perkins V federal funding)
- Direct employment pipelines for graduating students

> 💡 **Tip:** CTE programs are funded through a combination of general fund dollars, federal Perkins V funds, state CTE grants, and local partnerships. Board members should understand these funding streams because protecting CTE during budget cuts requires knowing which dollars are flexible and which are restricted.

---

### Dual Language Programs

Springfield operates dual language programs designed to develop biliteracy — proficiency in both English and a partner language.

#### Program Details

- **Languages:** Spanish-English is the primary model (as of the most recent available data)
- **Schools:** Dual language programs are offered at select elementary schools and may extend into middle school
- **Model:** Typically a **two-way immersion** model, where native English speakers and native Spanish speakers learn together, with instruction divided between the two languages (often 50/50 or 90/10 in early grades transitioning to 50/50)
- **Goals:** Biliteracy, bilingualism, cross-cultural competence, and academic achievement in both languages

#### Board Considerations

- Dual language programs require **long-term commitment** (5–7 years minimum) to show results
- They require **specialized teachers** (bilingual, biliterate, and often holding specific endorsements), which creates recruitment and retention challenges
- Community demand is high, but program slots may be limited
- Programs should be evaluated on **student outcomes in both languages**, not just English

---

### TAG — Talented and Gifted Services

Oregon law **requires** districts to identify and serve talented and gifted students.

#### Legal Requirements

- **ORS 343.391–343.413** — Requires districts to identify TAG students using multiple measures, including standardized tests, and to provide appropriate educational services.
- **OAR 581-022-2325 through 581-022-2330** — Administrative rules implementing TAG requirements.

#### Springfield's Approach

- Identification: Students are assessed using a combination of cognitive ability tests, academic achievement, and teacher/parent nominations.
- Services: May include acceleration (grade skipping, subject acceleration), enrichment, differentiated instruction, cluster grouping, and independent study.
- The district must have a **written TAG plan** that describes identification procedures and service delivery.
- Parents have the right to **appeal** TAG identification and service decisions.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Some board members believe TAG services are optional or a luxury during budget crises. They are not. TAG identification and services are **required by Oregon law**. Cutting TAG to zero is a legal violation, not a budget option. However, the *manner* of service delivery is flexible — the district can meet the requirement in cost-effective ways.

---

### Title I Programs

Title I of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides federal funding to schools with high percentages of students from low-income families.

#### Which Schools Qualify

In Springfield, most elementary schools and several middle schools receive Title I funding (as of the most recent available data). Eligibility is determined by the percentage of students qualifying for free or reduced-price meals.

#### How Funds Are Used

- Additional instructional staff (reading specialists, math interventionists)
- Extended learning time (before/after school programs, summer school)
- Professional development for teachers
- Parent and family engagement programs (required under Title I, Section 1116)
- Instructional materials and technology

#### Parent Engagement Requirements

Title I schools must:
- Hold an annual Title I parent meeting
- Develop a **parent and family engagement policy**
- Offer parents opportunities to participate in the design of the school's Title I program
- Provide information on their child's achievement and the qualifications of their child's teachers
- Create a **school-parent compact** describing how parents, staff, and students share responsibility for student achievement

### Alternative Education

Not all students thrive in traditional school settings. Springfield offers alternative education options:

- **Springfield Options Program** (or equivalent) — An alternative high school for students who need a different learning environment, smaller class sizes, or flexible scheduling
- **Online/virtual learning** — Available through Oregon's virtual school programs or district-provided options
- **GED preparation programs** — For students who have left traditional school and are working toward a GED
- **Transition programs** — For students aging out of special education services (through age 21)

Oregon law (**ORS 336.615–336.665**) requires districts to establish alternative education programs and specifies that students who are at risk of not meeting graduation requirements, who have been expelled, or who are deemed to need an alternative setting must be offered alternative education services.

---

### Special Education Overview

Special education is one of the most legally complex and budget-intensive areas of school district operations.

#### Federal and State Law

- **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Federal law requiring districts to provide a **Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)** in the **Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)** for all students with disabilities ages 3–21.
- **ORS Chapter 343** — Oregon's special education statutes, which implement IDEA requirements and add state-specific provisions.
- **Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act:** Requires accommodations for students with disabilities who may not qualify for IDEA services but still need support.

#### The IEP Process

Every student who qualifies for special education has an **Individualized Education Program (IEP)** — a legally binding document that specifies:
- The student's present levels of performance
- Annual goals
- Special education and related services (speech therapy, occupational therapy, counseling, etc.)
- Accommodations and modifications
- Placement (general education, resource room, self-contained, etc.)

The IEP is developed by a team that includes parents, teachers, special education staff, and the student (when appropriate).

#### The Board's Role

- **Policy level:** Adopt policies ensuring IDEA/504 compliance
- **Budget:** Ensure adequate funding for special education (typically 15–20% of the general fund in Springfield, as of the most recent available data)
- **Oversight:** Monitor compliance through reports from the superintendent
- **Do NOT** get involved in individual IEP decisions — this is management, and it creates legal liability

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Parents of students with disabilities sometimes approach board members to intervene in IEP disputes. Board members should **listen empathetically** but direct parents to the district's special education office and the formal dispute resolution processes (mediation, due process hearing, state complaint). Intervening in individual cases is inappropriate at the governance level and can create legal complications for the district.

---

### Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and Student Mental Health

The COVID-19 pandemic amplified already-growing concerns about student mental health. Springfield's post-pandemic priorities include:

- **Expanded counseling services** — More school counselors and mental health professionals in buildings
- **SEL curriculum integration** — Teaching social-emotional skills (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, responsible decision-making) across grade levels
- **Trauma-informed practices** — Training staff to recognize and respond to student trauma
- **Crisis intervention protocols** — Suicide prevention, threat assessment, and crisis response teams
- **Community partnerships** — Connections with Lane County behavioral health services, community mental health providers, and nonprofit organizations

Student mental health is a **high community priority** and a recurring topic at board meetings. Board members should:
- Support adequate staffing for mental health services
- Ensure policies protect student privacy (FERPA, HIPAA)
- Advocate for state and federal funding for mental health programs
- Be aware that SEL programs can sometimes generate political controversy — prepare to communicate clearly about what the district's program includes and what it does not

---

### Equity Initiatives

Springfield has made public commitments to educational equity. Key elements include:

- **Equity policy** — A board-adopted policy committing the district to eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps based on race, ethnicity, income, disability, language, gender, and other factors
- **Disaggregated data analysis** — Regularly reviewing student outcome data broken down by demographic groups to identify and address gaps
- **Culturally responsive teaching** — Professional development helping teachers connect instruction to students' cultural backgrounds and experiences
- **Diverse hiring** — Efforts to recruit and retain staff who reflect the student population's diversity
- **Community engagement** — Partnerships with community organizations serving underrepresented populations

Springfield's student demographics (as of the most recent available data) include approximately:
- 55–60% White
- 25–30% Hispanic/Latino
- 3–5% Multiracial
- 1–3% Black/African American
- 1–2% Native American/Alaska Native
- 1–2% Asian/Pacific Islander

Achievement gaps between White students and students of color, between economically disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students, and between students with and without disabilities are persistent and documented.

---

### Student Outcomes Data

Board members must be able to read and interpret student outcome data. Key metrics for Springfield (approximate figures as of the most recent available data):

| Metric | Springfield | Oregon Average | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4-Year Graduation Rate** | ~78–82% | ~82–84% | Below state average; varies by subgroup |
| **5-Year Completion Rate** | ~83–87% | ~85–88% | Includes GED and modified diplomas |
| **ELA Proficiency (Gr. 3–8)** | ~38–42% | ~43–47% | Based on OSAS (Oregon Statewide Assessment) |
| **Math Proficiency (Gr. 3–8)** | ~28–33% | ~33–37% | Significant equity gaps |
| **Science Proficiency (Gr. 5, 8, 11)** | ~30–35% | ~32–36% | NGSS-aligned assessments |
| **Regular Attendance Rate** | ~70–75% | ~72–76% | Chronic absenteeism is a major concern |
| **College-Going Rate** | ~50–55% | ~55–60% | Within 16 months of graduation |

> 💡 **Tip:** Statewide proficiency rates dropped significantly during the pandemic and have not fully recovered. Board members should look at **trends over time**, not just a single year's snapshot. Ask the superintendent: "Are we improving? Are gaps narrowing? Which strategies are working?"

---

### Community Engagement on Curriculum

Curriculum and program decisions generate significant community interest. Springfield uses several engagement mechanisms:

#### Advisory Committees

- **Instructional materials adoption committees** (required by ORS 337.050)
- **CTE advisory committees** (required by Perkins V)
- **Title I parent advisory committees**
- **TAG advisory committee**
- **District budget committee** (reviews program funding)
- **Superintendent's community advisory groups** (ad hoc, on specific issues)

#### Parent Organizations

- PTO/PTA groups at individual schools
- Booster clubs for athletics, music, and other programs
- District-level parent advisory councils

#### Public Input Processes

- Public comment periods at board meetings
- Community forums and listening sessions on specific topics
- Online surveys and feedback forms
- Social media engagement (with appropriate moderation)

> 💡 **Tip:** Community engagement works best when it is **proactive** (seeking input before decisions are made) rather than **reactive** (responding after decisions generate controversy). Build engagement into the decision-making process, not as an afterthought.

---

### Recent Controversies and Hot Topics

School boards across Oregon — and the nation — are navigating an era of heightened public attention to curriculum. Springfield is not immune. Topics that may arise include:

#### Book Challenges

- Parents or community members may formally challenge books in school libraries or classroom use.
- Oregon law and district policy provide a **formal reconsideration process** (board policy typically KEC or equivalent) that includes a review committee.
- Board members should **not** pre-judge challenges. Follow the policy and trust the process.
- The American Library Association and the Oregon Library Association provide resources on intellectual freedom and challenged materials.

#### Curriculum Transparency

- Increasing demand for parents to see exactly what is being taught, including lesson plans, materials, and classroom activities.
- Oregon law (ORS 337.141) gives parents the right to inspect instructional materials.
- Districts should have clear processes for responding to parent requests.

#### Parental Rights

- Oregon's **Parental Rights in Education** statute (ORS 339.880 and related sections) ensures parents have the right to be involved in their children's education.
- Tensions can arise around opt-out provisions (particularly for health/sexuality education under ORS 336.035 and ORS 336.455), gender-related policies, and student privacy.
- Board members should know the law, follow district policy, and avoid making promises that may conflict with legal requirements.

#### Ethnic Studies and Diverse Perspectives

- Oregon law (HB 2845, HB 2023) requires the integration of ethnic studies content — including the histories and contributions of Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and other underrepresented groups — across the curriculum.
- This is a legal requirement, not a discretionary choice. However, **how** it is implemented is a matter of professional judgment.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes take strong public positions on individual book challenges or specific curriculum content before the formal review process is complete. This compromises the board's ability to act as a fair and impartial decision-maker if the matter comes before the board on appeal. Let the process work.

---

### How Board Members Should Engage with Curriculum Questions

The governance–management distinction is especially important in curriculum:

**Do:**
- Ask about student outcomes data and trends
- Inquire about the alignment of programs with the district's strategic plan
- Request reports on curriculum adoption processes and timelines
- Ask how instructional programs serve all student subgroups equitably
- Set policy expectations (e.g., "all students will have access to a rigorous, standards-aligned curriculum")
- Approve or reject instructional materials adoptions recommended through the proper committee process

**Don't:**
- Tell teachers what to teach or how to teach it
- Select or reject individual textbooks or library books outside the formal process
- Direct the superintendent to hire or fire specific instructional staff
- Make curriculum promises to individual parents or community groups
- Conduct your own "investigation" of classroom instruction

The policy lever is the board's most powerful tool. A well-crafted curriculum policy sets expectations that the superintendent must meet — without dictating the operational details.

---

### School Improvement Plans

Each school in Springfield develops a **School Improvement Plan (SIP)** that outlines:

- Student achievement goals (aligned with district goals and state requirements)
- Strategies for improving instruction
- Professional development priorities
- Data sources used to measure progress
- Plans for engaging families and community

The board does not approve individual SIPs — that is an administrative function — but should monitor the alignment of school-level goals with district-wide priorities. The superintendent should report regularly on school improvement progress.

Under ESSA, schools identified for **Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI)** or **Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI)** based on performance data must implement specific improvement strategies and may receive additional state support and oversight.

---

### Technology in Instruction

Technology is embedded throughout Springfield's instructional program:

#### 1:1 Device Programs

Springfield has moved toward **1:1 device programs** (one laptop or Chromebook per student), accelerated by the pandemic. Key considerations:

- **Equity:** Ensuring all students have equal access to devices and reliable internet (the "digital divide" is real in Springfield's more rural areas)
- **Digital literacy:** Teaching students to use technology productively, safely, and ethically
- **Screen time:** Balancing the benefits of technology with concerns about excessive screen time, particularly for younger students
- **Maintenance and replacement:** The cost of maintaining and replacing devices is ongoing — approximately $200–400 per device over a 3–4 year lifecycle
- **Cybersecurity and student privacy:** Compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and FERPA, as well as Oregon's Student Information Protection Act (ORS 336.184)

#### Digital Curriculum and Adaptive Learning

Many instructional programs now include digital components:
- Adaptive learning platforms that adjust to each student's level
- Online assessments and progress monitoring
- Digital textbooks and supplementary resources
- Learning management systems (LMS) for organizing coursework

> 💡 **Tip:** Technology is a **tool**, not a strategy. Board members should ask: "What is the instructional purpose of this technology?" and "How is it improving student outcomes?" — not "How many devices do we have?"

---

### Student Outcomes vs. State Averages

| Outcome Measure | Springfield | Oregon Average | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd Grade ELA Proficiency | ~37% | ~44% | –7 pts |
| 3rd Grade Math Proficiency | ~32% | ~39% | –7 pts |
| 8th Grade ELA Proficiency | ~42% | ~48% | –6 pts |
| 8th Grade Math Proficiency | ~28% | ~35% | –7 pts |
| 4-Year Graduation Rate | ~80% | ~83% | –3 pts |
| Chronic Absenteeism Rate | ~28% | ~25% | +3 pts (worse) |
| College-Going Rate | ~53% | ~58% | –5 pts |

*Figures are approximate and based on the most recent available data. Actual figures may vary by year.*

These gaps are not enormous, but they are persistent — and they widen significantly when disaggregated by race, income, and disability status. Closing them requires sustained investment in effective instructional programs, targeted interventions, and equitable resource allocation.

---

### Summary

Curriculum, programs, and community priorities are the substance of public education — and the area where board members will face the most passionate public input. Your role as a board member is to:

1. **Understand the legal framework** — Know what ORS requires, what ODE mandates, and where the board has discretion.
2. **Set policy expectations** — Adopt policies that demand a rigorous, equitable, standards-aligned instructional program for all students.
3. **Approve major decisions** — Instructional materials adoptions, new program launches, and graduation requirements come to the board for approval.
4. **Monitor outcomes** — Regularly review student achievement data, disaggregated by subgroup, and hold the superintendent accountable for progress.
5. **Engage the community** — Listen to parents, community members, and students. Build engagement into the process, not just at the crisis point.
6. **Stay in your lane** — Governance, not management. Policy, not pedagogy. Strategic direction, not lesson plans.

The programs Springfield offers — from structured literacy to CTE to dual language to TAG to special education — represent the district's commitment to serving every student. Protecting and improving those programs, even in the face of budget constraints, is the board's most important work.
