## Overview

Parliamentary procedure exists for a single purpose: to allow a group of people to make collective decisions in a fair, orderly, and efficient manner. For school boards, Robert's Rules of Order is the standard framework that governs how meetings are conducted, how motions are made and decided, and how members' rights to speak and vote are protected. Mastering the basics of Robert's Rules is not about rigid formality — it is about ensuring that every board member has an equal voice and that the public can follow and trust the decision-making process.

School boards operate under tremendous public scrutiny. Every vote affects students, families, staff, and taxpayers. When meetings devolve into confusion — when it is unclear what is being voted on, who has the floor, or whether a motion is in order — public trust erodes. Robert's Rules provides the structure that prevents this. It ensures that one item is considered at a time, that every member has the opportunity to speak, and that decisions are made by majority vote after fair deliberation.

Oregon school boards typically adopt Robert's Rules of Order (or a simplified version) as their parliamentary authority through board policy. While small boards rarely need the full complexity of Robert's Rules — which runs over 700 pages in its current edition — every board member should understand the fundamentals. These are the tools of democratic governance, and fluency in them separates effective board members from those who sit confused while others control the process.

This module provides a comprehensive guide to parliamentary procedure as it applies to Oregon school boards, from the basic motion lifecycle through advanced concepts like amendments to amendments, order of precedence, and the critical difference between tabling and postponing.

### Why Parliamentary Procedure Matters for Public Bodies

Parliamentary procedure is not bureaucratic red tape. For public bodies like school boards, it serves several essential functions:

- **Fairness:** Every member has equal rights — to make motions, to speak in debate, and to vote. No member can dominate or be silenced.
- **Efficiency:** By considering one thing at a time and following a structured process, boards avoid circular discussions and reach decisions faster.
- **Transparency:** The public can follow what is happening. When a motion is pending, everyone — board members and audience alike — knows exactly what is being decided.
- **Legal protection:** Decisions made following proper parliamentary procedure are more defensible if challenged. A vote taken without a proper motion, or on a matter not on the agenda, can be voided.
- **Minority rights with majority rule:** The majority decides, but the minority has the right to be heard. Procedures like debate rules, the right to amend, and the right to vote "no" protect the minority from being steamrolled.

> **💡 Tip:** Think of parliamentary procedure as the "operating system" of your board meetings. You do not need to know every technical detail, but you need to know enough to participate effectively and to recognize when something has gone wrong.

### The Complete Motion Lifecycle

Every substantive board action follows a six-step process. Understanding this lifecycle is fundamental:

**Step 1: A member makes a motion.**
A board member who has been recognized by the chair says: *"I move that the board approve the 2026–27 budget as presented."* The motion should be clear, specific, and affirmative (move *to do* something, not *to not do* something when possible).

**Step 2: Another member seconds the motion.**
A second member says: *"Second."* The second does not mean the member agrees with the motion — it simply means at least two people think the matter deserves discussion. Without a second, the motion dies. The chair would say: *"The motion is not seconded and is not before the board."*

**Step 3: The chair states the motion.**
The chair repeats the motion so everyone is clear: *"It has been moved and seconded that the board approve the 2026–27 budget as presented. Is there discussion?"* At this point, the motion belongs to the board, not to the maker. The maker cannot withdraw it without the board's consent.

**Step 4: The board debates the motion.**
Members who wish to speak are recognized by the chair. Debate must be relevant to the pending motion. Members address their remarks through the chair, not directly to other members. Each member may speak twice on a motion, and no one should speak a second time until everyone who wishes to speak has had a chance.

**Step 5: The chair puts the question to a vote.**
When debate appears exhausted (or when the board votes to close debate), the chair says: *"The question is on the adoption of the motion that the board approve the 2026–27 budget as presented. All those in favor say 'aye.' All those opposed say 'no.'"*

**Step 6: The chair announces the result.**
*"The ayes have it and the motion is adopted. The 2026–27 budget is approved as presented."* Or: *"The noes have it and the motion is lost."* The announcement must be clear and definitive so the record reflects exactly what happened.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Many boards skip Step 3 (the chair stating the motion) and jump straight to discussion. This creates confusion about exactly what is being discussed and voted on. Always insist that the chair clearly state the motion before debate begins.

### The Four Types of Motions

Robert's Rules classifies all motions into four categories, each serving a different purpose. Understanding the categories helps you know what tools are available to you at any point in a meeting.

#### Main Motions

A **main motion** introduces new business for the board's consideration. It can only be made when no other motion is pending. Examples:

- *"I move that the board adopt Policy JFCF – Bullying Prevention, as presented."*
- *"I move that the board approve the contract with ABC Construction in the amount of $2.4 million."*
- *"I move that the board direct the superintendent to develop a plan for expanding pre-kindergarten programs and report back by March."*

Main motions are the lowest-ranking motions — almost any other type of motion can be applied to them.

#### Subsidiary Motions

**Subsidiary motions** act on a pending main motion to modify it, delay it, or dispose of it. They are listed here in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

| Rank | Motion | Purpose | Debatable? | Amendable? | Vote Required |
|------|--------|---------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 7 | Lay on the Table | Temporarily set aside to address urgent matter | No | No | Majority |
| 6 | Previous Question (Close Debate) | End debate and vote immediately | No | No | Two-thirds |
| 5 | Limit or Extend Debate | Set time limits on discussion | No | Yes | Two-thirds |
| 4 | Postpone to a Certain Time | Delay consideration to a specific meeting | Yes | Yes | Majority |
| 3 | Refer to Committee | Send to a committee for study | Yes | Yes | Majority |
| 2 | Amend | Modify the wording of the pending motion | Yes | Yes | Majority |
| 1 | Postpone Indefinitely | Kill the motion without a direct vote | Yes | No | Majority |

**Examples of subsidiary motions in practice:**

- *"I move to amend the motion by changing the contract amount from $2.4 million to $2.2 million."*
- *"I move to refer the bullying prevention policy to the policy committee for further review."*
- *"I move to postpone consideration of this item to the February meeting."*
- *"I move the previous question."* (This means "I want to stop debate and vote now.")

#### Privileged Motions

**Privileged motions** relate to the rights and needs of the assembly itself, not to the pending business. They take precedence over all other motions.

| Rank | Motion | Purpose | Debatable? | Vote Required |
|------|--------|---------|------------|---------------|
| 3 | Adjourn (Fix Time / Adjourn) | End the meeting or set time for next meeting | No | Majority |
| 2 | Recess | Take a short break | No | Majority |
| 1 | Question of Privilege | Address comfort, safety, or rights of members | No | Chair rules |

**Examples:**

- *"I move that we take a ten-minute recess."* (Useful when tensions are high or the meeting has been going three hours.)
- *"I move to adjourn."*
- *"I rise to a question of privilege — the audience cannot hear the discussion. Can we adjust the microphones?"*

#### Incidental Motions

**Incidental motions** arise out of the pending business and must be addressed immediately. They have no rank relative to each other but take precedence over the motion out of which they arise.

| Motion | Purpose | Debatable? | Vote Required |
|--------|---------|------------|---------------|
| Point of Order | Call attention to a rule violation | No | Chair rules |
| Appeal the Decision of the Chair | Challenge the chair's ruling | Yes | Majority |
| Division of the Assembly | Request a counted vote | No | No vote needed |
| Parliamentary Inquiry | Ask the chair a question about procedure | No | No vote needed |
| Point of Information | Request factual information | No | No vote needed |
| Suspend the Rules | Temporarily set aside a procedural rule | No | Two-thirds |
| Object to Consideration | Prevent discussion of a motion entirely | No | Two-thirds |
| Division of the Question | Separate a motion into parts for individual votes | No | Majority |

**Examples:**

- *"Point of order — I believe we need a two-thirds vote on this motion, not a simple majority."*
- *"I appeal the decision of the chair."* (This puts the chair's ruling to a vote of the full board.)
- *"Division!"* (After a voice vote that seems close, any member can demand a counted vote.)
- *"Parliamentary inquiry — is it in order to amend this motion at this time?"*

### Order of Precedence — Complete Table

When multiple motions are pending, the order of precedence determines which must be dealt with first. Higher-ranking motions can be made while lower-ranking motions are pending, but not vice versa.

| Rank | Motion | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| 13 | Fix the Time to Which to Adjourn | Privileged |
| 12 | Adjourn | Privileged |
| 11 | Recess | Privileged |
| 10 | Raise a Question of Privilege | Privileged |
| 9 | Lay on the Table | Subsidiary |
| 8 | Previous Question (Close Debate) | Subsidiary |
| 7 | Limit or Extend Limits of Debate | Subsidiary |
| 6 | Postpone to a Certain Time | Subsidiary |
| 5 | Refer to Committee | Subsidiary |
| 4 | Amend | Subsidiary |
| 3 | Postpone Indefinitely | Subsidiary |
| 2 | Main Motion | Main |
| 1 | (Incidental motions — no fixed rank; handled as they arise) | Incidental |

> **💡 Tip:** You do not need to memorize this table. But you should understand the principle: you can always move "up" the table (make a higher-ranking motion while a lower one is pending) but never "down" (you cannot introduce a main motion while an amendment is being debated).

---

### Debatable vs. Non-Debatable Motions

Knowing which motions can be debated saves time and prevents procedural errors.

| Motion | Debatable? | Why? |
|--------|------------|------|
| Main Motion | Yes | This is the board's core business — full discussion is expected |
| Amend | Yes | Members need to discuss whether the change improves the motion |
| Postpone to a Certain Time | Yes | Members may disagree about whether delay is appropriate |
| Refer to Committee | Yes | Members may have views on whether a committee should study it |
| Postpone Indefinitely | Yes | This effectively kills the motion, so debate is warranted |
| Appeal the Decision of the Chair | Yes | Members should understand the reasoning before voting |
| Previous Question (Close Debate) | No | Debating whether to stop debate would be circular |
| Lay on the Table | No | Tabling is meant for urgent situations; debate would defeat the purpose |
| Limit or Extend Debate | No | Same reasoning as previous question |
| Recess | No | Simple procedural matter |
| Adjourn | No | Simple procedural matter |
| Point of Order | No | The chair rules; no debate needed |
| Division | No | Any member has the right to a counted vote |

### Voting Methods

Oregon school boards typically use several voting methods, depending on the situation and board policy:

**Voice Vote (Viva Voce):** The standard method for most motions. The chair asks for "ayes" and "noes" and judges which side prevails. Quick and efficient for routine matters.

**Show of Hands or Standing Vote:** Used when a voice vote is inconclusive, or when a member calls for "Division." Provides a visual count that is easier to verify.

**Roll Call Vote:** Each member's name is called and they respond "aye" or "no," which is recorded in the minutes. Oregon law requires a roll call vote for certain actions, including budget adoption and some personnel actions. Many boards use roll call for all action items to maintain transparency and a clear public record.

**Ballot Vote:** Used when secrecy is desired, such as elections of officers. Rarely used in Oregon school board meetings because of public transparency expectations and public meetings law.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some boards develop a habit of using "unanimous consent" or voice votes for everything, including significant policy changes and large expenditures. Best practice — and often legal requirement — is to use roll call votes for all substantive actions so the public can see how each member voted. Oregon's public meetings law (ORS 192.650) requires that the vote of each member be recorded in the minutes for all actions taken.

### The Chair's Role in Detail

The board chair is the presiding officer and has unique responsibilities under Robert's Rules:

#### Facilitating Business
- Calls the meeting to order and verifies quorum
- Follows the agenda and announces each item of business
- Recognizes members who wish to speak
- States each motion before debate and before the vote
- Announces the results of every vote clearly

#### Managing Debate
- Ensures speakers stay on the topic of the pending motion
- Enforces time limits if the board has adopted them
- Ensures no member speaks a second time until all who wish to speak have done so
- Can ask a member to confine their remarks to the question at hand
- Does not allow personal attacks or inappropriate language

#### Maintaining Neutrality
- The chair should remain impartial during debate
- If the chair wishes to advocate for or against a motion, they should pass the gavel to the vice-chair and speak as a regular member
- After speaking, the chair should not resume the gavel until the pending motion is disposed of (strict interpretation) or may resume the gavel after speaking (common practice in small boards)

#### When Does the Chair Vote?
- Under strict Robert's Rules, the chair votes only when the vote is by ballot or when the chair's vote will change the outcome (to create or break a tie)
- However, most Oregon school boards allow the chair to vote on all matters, since the chair is an elected member with the same representative obligations
- Check your board's bylaws for the specific rule your board follows

#### Ruling on Procedure
- The chair rules on points of order and parliamentary inquiries
- If a member disagrees with the chair's ruling, they can appeal, which puts the decision to the full board
- A skilled chair explains their rulings so members understand the reasoning

> **💡 Tip:** A good chair is like a good referee — you barely notice them when things are going well. The chair's job is to facilitate, not to dominate. Chairs who use their position to control outcomes or silence dissent quickly lose the trust of the board and the public.

### Quorum Requirements Under Oregon Law

A **quorum** is the minimum number of members who must be present for the board to conduct official business. Under **ORS 332.045**, a majority of the total board membership constitutes a quorum.

| Board Size | Quorum |
|-----------|--------|
| 5 members | 3 must be present |
| 7 members | 4 must be present |

**Key quorum rules:**
- If a quorum is not present, the board cannot vote, adopt policy, or take any binding action
- The board may still hear reports or have informal discussion, but no official action
- If a quorum is lost during a meeting (members leave), the board must stop taking action
- A member who has recused themselves from a specific vote is still counted for quorum purposes (they are present, just not voting)
- Members attending by phone or video count toward quorum if the board's policies and Oregon law permit remote participation
- The chair should verify quorum before calling the meeting to order

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A seven-member board has a contentious item on the agenda. Two members with conflicts of interest recuse themselves. Two other members are absent. The remaining three members vote 2-1 to approve the item. Is this valid? Yes — four members are *present* (including the two recused members), which is a quorum. The motion passes with a majority of those voting.

---

### Common Parliamentary Mistakes Boards Make

1. **Discussing before there is a motion on the floor.** The proper sequence is motion → second → chair states → debate. Many boards start debating a topic before anyone has made a motion, which means there is no clear proposal to focus the discussion.

2. **Confusing "tabling" with "postponing."** These are different motions with very different effects (see below).

3. **Not stating the motion before the vote.** The chair should always restate the exact motion before calling for a vote, so there is no confusion about what is being decided.

4. **Allowing members to speak without being recognized.** Even in small, informal boards, the chair should recognize each speaker to maintain order and ensure the minutes accurately reflect who said what.

5. **Using "I so move" without specifying the motion.** A motion must state exactly what action is proposed. "I so move" after a discussion does not create a clear motion unless the chair clarifies exactly what is being moved.

6. **Voting on things not on the agenda.** Oregon's public meetings law generally requires that the public have notice of the topics to be discussed. Voting on matters not on the published agenda can be legally problematic.

7. **Failing to announce vote results.** The chair must clearly state whether the motion passed or failed and what the vote count was. This is the official record.

8. **Requiring unanimity when only a majority is needed.** Most motions require a simple majority. Only a few (like closing debate or suspending the rules) require two-thirds.

### Practical Scenarios: "What Happens When..."

#### Scenario 1: A member wants to change a motion that is on the floor
During debate on a motion to approve a $500,000 technology purchase, a board member thinks the amount should be $400,000. The member says: *"I move to amend the motion by striking '$500,000' and inserting '$400,000'."* Another member seconds. The chair states the amendment. The board debates the amendment only (not the original motion). The board votes on the amendment. If it passes, the main motion now reads with $400,000. The board then debates and votes on the amended main motion.

#### Scenario 2: A member wants to stop debate and vote immediately
After 45 minutes of debate, a member feels the board has heard enough. The member says: *"I move the previous question."* This requires a second. It is not debatable. The chair immediately takes a vote: *"Shall debate be closed? All in favor... All opposed..."* This requires a **two-thirds vote**. If it passes, the chair immediately puts the pending motion to a vote with no further debate.

#### Scenario 3: A member believes a rule has been violated
During a discussion, the chair allows a member to make a new main motion while an amendment is still pending. Another member says: *"Point of order — there is an amendment pending. A new main motion is not in order."* The chair rules on the point: *"The point is well taken. The amendment must be disposed of before a new main motion can be made."*

#### Scenario 4: The vote seems too close to call
After a voice vote, a member is unsure which side prevailed. The member calls: *"Division!"* The chair must then retake the vote by show of hands or roll call. Any member can demand a division; no second or vote is needed.

#### Scenario 5: A member wants to bring back a defeated motion
A motion to close an elementary school was defeated at the October meeting. At the November meeting, a member wants to try again. This requires a **motion to reconsider** (if made at the same meeting) or a new main motion at a subsequent meeting. If a new main motion, it can be made if circumstances have changed or new information is available. Some boards adopt rules limiting how soon a defeated motion can be brought back.

#### Scenario 6: The board needs to handle an urgent matter during pending business
During debate on a policy revision, the fire alarm goes off. A member says: *"I rise to a question of privilege — we need to evacuate the building."* The chair immediately addresses the safety issue, recessing the meeting if necessary. Privileged motions take precedence over all pending business.

---

### Amendments to Amendments

Robert's Rules allows one level of amendment to an amendment — but no deeper. Here is how it works:

1. **Main motion** is on the floor: *"I move to adopt the new student dress code policy."*
2. **Primary amendment** is offered: *"I move to amend by adding: 'The policy shall take effect at the start of the 2026–27 school year.'"*
3. **Secondary amendment** is offered: *"I move to amend the amendment by striking '2026–27' and inserting '2027–28'."*

At this point, no further amendments can be offered until the secondary amendment is disposed of. The board votes on the secondary amendment first (2027–28 vs. 2026–27), then on the primary amendment as amended (or not), then on the main motion as amended (or not).

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board member tries to amend the secondary amendment. This is out of order — Robert's Rules allows only two levels of amendment (primary and secondary) to prevent infinite complexity.

---

### Tabling vs. Postponing — The Critical Difference

These two motions are frequently confused, but they serve entirely different purposes:

| Feature | Lay on the Table | Postpone to a Certain Time |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Temporarily set aside to address something more urgent | Delay consideration to a specific future date |
| **Debatable?** | No | Yes |
| **When to use** | An urgent matter has come up that requires immediate attention | The board needs more information, or a later date is more appropriate |
| **How to resume** | Requires a motion to "take from the table" at the same or next meeting | Automatically comes up at the specified time |
| **Effect if not resumed** | Dies at the end of the next regular meeting if not taken from the table | Comes back automatically |
| **Common misuse** | Used to avoid voting on something — this is improper | None — this is the proper motion for delay |

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Board members often say "I move to table this" when they really mean "I move to postpone this to next month." Tabling is for emergencies — something urgent has come up and you need to temporarily set the current item aside. If you want to delay a decision, the correct motion is to **postpone to a certain time**. Misusing "table" to avoid a vote is improper and can be ruled out of order.

---

### Unanimous Consent

For routine or non-controversial matters, the chair can save time by using **unanimous consent** (also called "general consent"). Instead of going through the full motion process, the chair says:

*"If there is no objection, we will approve the minutes of the January meeting as presented."* (Pause.) *"Hearing no objection, the minutes are approved."*

If any member objects, the chair must process the item through a formal motion and vote. Unanimous consent is appropriate for:

- Approving minutes with no corrections
- Accepting routine reports
- Making minor corrections to previous actions
- Adjusting the order of business on the agenda

Unanimous consent should **not** be used for controversial items, significant expenditures, policy changes, or any matter where a recorded vote is important for public accountability.

> **💡 Tip:** As a new board member, do not be afraid to object to unanimous consent if you believe a matter deserves formal discussion and a recorded vote. Saying "I object" is not rude — it is your right, and it forces the item through proper procedure.

---

### Key Takeaways

- Parliamentary procedure protects fairness, efficiency, and transparency in board decision-making.
- Every action follows the six-step lifecycle: motion → second → state → debate → vote → announce.
- The four motion types (main, subsidiary, privileged, incidental) give you specific tools for different situations.
- The chair's role is to facilitate, not dominate — neutrality is essential.
- Oregon law requires a quorum (majority of total membership) for the board to act.
- Tabling and postponing are different motions — learn the distinction and use the correct one.
- Unanimous consent saves time on routine items but should not replace formal votes on substantive matters.
- When in doubt about procedure, raise a parliamentary inquiry — it is always in order.
