## Overview

Springfield Public Schools, officially designated as Springfield School District 19 (SD 19), is one of the larger school districts in Lane County, Oregon. The district serves approximately 8,000 or more students across 21 schools spanning pre-kindergarten through grade 12. Its administrative headquarters are located at 640 A Street, Springfield, Oregon 97477, and the district can be reached by phone at (541) 747-3331.

While the district's name references the city of Springfield, its geographic service area extends well beyond city limits. SD 19 encompasses the communities of Springfield, Goshen, Mohawk, Walterville, and Marcola — a broad swath of eastern Lane County that includes both urban neighborhoods and rural areas. This geographic diversity means the district serves families with a wide range of backgrounds, needs, and expectations, making community responsiveness a central challenge and priority for the school board.

Springfield Public Schools operates under the leadership of a superintendent, who serves as the chief executive officer of the district. The superintendent is hired by and reports directly to the board of directors as a body — not to any individual board member. This distinction is fundamental to effective governance: the board sets policy and direction, while the superintendent manages day-to-day operations. The administrative organizational chart reflects this structure, with building principals, department heads, and support staff reporting up through the superintendent's office.

For new board members, understanding the district's size, structure, and community context is an essential starting point. Decisions about budgets, staffing, curriculum, and facilities all take place within the context of who the district serves and how it is organized. The district's official website, springfield.k12.or.us, is the primary public resource for information about schools, programs, board meetings, and district news.

## Key Concepts

### District Size and Scope

Springfield SD 19 operates 21 schools serving students from pre-kindergarten through grade 12. This includes elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools, as well as alternative and specialized programs. With approximately 8,000 or more students enrolled, the district is a significant institution in the region — one of the largest employers in Springfield and a cornerstone of community life. The breadth of the district's operations means that board decisions affect thousands of families, hundreds of staff members, and a wide variety of educational programs.

### Geographic Service Area

The district's boundaries encompass not just the city of Springfield but also several surrounding unincorporated communities in Lane County: Goshen, Mohawk, Walterville, and Marcola. This means the board represents a diverse constituency — urban, suburban, and rural families with different access to services, different transportation needs, and different community identities. Board members should be aware that policies and resource allocation decisions may affect these communities differently, and that meaningful engagement requires reaching beyond the city center.

### Administrative Organization and the Superintendent

The superintendent is the district's chief executive, responsible for implementing board policy, managing staff, overseeing day-to-day operations, and advising the board on educational and fiscal matters. The superintendent reports to the board as a whole — not to the board chair or any individual member. This governance principle protects the professional independence of the superintendent while ensuring accountability to the elected board. The administrative org chart places the superintendent at the top of the operational hierarchy, with principals, directors, and department heads reporting through clearly defined lines of authority.

### The District Website as a Public Resource

Springfield Public Schools maintains its official website at springfield.k12.or.us. This site serves as the primary public-facing portal for district information, including school directories, board meeting agendas and minutes, enrollment data, employment opportunities, and news. For board members, the website is both a governance tool and a window into how the district communicates with the community. Familiarity with the site's structure and content helps board members stay informed and respond to constituent questions.
