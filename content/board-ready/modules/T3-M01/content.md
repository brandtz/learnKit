## Overview

Springfield Public Schools — officially Springfield School District 19 (SD 19) — is one of the largest and most complex school districts in Lane County, Oregon. Serving approximately 10,000 students across more than 20 schools, the district spans a geographic area that stretches from the urban core of Springfield through suburban neighborhoods and into genuinely rural communities in eastern Lane County. The district's administrative headquarters are located at 640 A Street, Springfield, Oregon 97477.

For a new board member, understanding the district you govern is not optional — it is the foundation upon which every policy decision, budget vote, and strategic priority rests. You cannot make informed decisions about staffing ratios, school closures, program investments, or bond measures without a thorough understanding of who the district serves, how it is organized, what resources it has, and what challenges it faces. This module provides that foundation.

Springfield SD 19 is not simply a collection of schools. It is the largest employer in the city of Springfield, a major economic engine for the community, a social safety net for thousands of families, and one of the most visible public institutions in Lane County. The decisions you make as a board member will affect children, families, staff, and taxpayers for years — and in the case of facilities and bond decisions, for decades.

### District History and Community Context

#### Springfield, Oregon — The City and the Region

Springfield is located in Lane County in western Oregon, immediately east of and adjacent to the city of Eugene. Together, the two cities form the Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area, the second-largest metro area in Oregon after the Portland metro, with a combined population of approximately 380,000. Springfield itself has a population of roughly 63,000–65,000 (as of the most recent available data), making it one of the larger cities in Oregon in its own right.

The city was incorporated in 1885 and grew up around the timber industry. For much of the 20th century, Springfield's economy was dominated by lumber mills and wood-products manufacturing — including the Weyerhaeuser and Georgia-Pacific operations that once employed thousands of residents. The decline of the timber industry beginning in the 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s forced a painful economic transition. Today, Springfield's economy is more diversified, with healthcare (PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend is one of the largest employers in Lane County), retail, light manufacturing, technology, and public-sector employment forming the economic base. The University of Oregon in neighboring Eugene and Lane Community College (LCC) are also significant economic and educational anchors for the region.

Despite this diversification, Springfield retains a working-class identity that distinguishes it from neighboring Eugene. Median household income in Springfield is lower than the state average, poverty rates are higher, and the city has historically attracted families seeking more affordable housing than Eugene's market provides. These economic realities are directly reflected in the district's student demographics — higher rates of poverty, greater reliance on free and reduced-price lunch, and higher demand for social services and wraparound supports in schools.

#### Geographic Scope of the District

Springfield SD 19's boundaries extend well beyond the city limits. The district encompasses the communities of:

- **Springfield** — the urban core, including downtown, the Gateway area, and established residential neighborhoods
- **Thurston** — a large suburban/semi-rural area on the eastern edge of Springfield
- **Goshen** — an unincorporated community south of Springfield along Highway 99
- **Mohawk** — a rural community northeast of Springfield along the Mohawk River
- **Walterville** — a small rural community east of Springfield along the McKenzie River
- **Marcola** — a small, isolated rural community in the Mohawk Valley, approximately 15 miles north of Springfield

This geographic diversity means the district serves a wide range of communities with different needs, different access to services, and different expectations. A family in downtown Springfield has a very different experience than a family on a 10-acre parcel in Marcola. Transportation, access to broadband internet, proximity to social services, and commute times to school all vary dramatically across the district's footprint.

> **💡 Tip:** As a board member, make a point of visiting schools across the full geographic range of the district — not just the ones closest to your home. Understanding the experience of families in Mohawk, Walterville, and Marcola will give you perspective that significantly improves your decision-making on transportation, facilities, and resource allocation.

### District Statistics and Enrollment

As of the most recent available data, Springfield SD 19 serves approximately **10,000–10,500 students** in grades pre-kindergarten through 12. This enrollment figure has been relatively stable in recent years but reflects a gradual decline from peak enrollment levels the district experienced in the early 2000s — a trend common to many Oregon districts outside the Portland metro area.

| Metric | Approximate Figure |
|---|---|
| Total enrollment (K–12) | ~10,000–10,500 |
| Number of schools | 21–23 (varies with program sites) |
| Elementary schools | 14–15 |
| Middle schools | 3 |
| High schools | 2 comprehensive + alternative programs |
| Licensed (certificated) staff | ~600–650 |
| Classified (support) staff | ~500–550 |
| Administrative staff | ~60–80 |
| Total employees | ~1,200–1,300 |

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** New board members sometimes compare Springfield's enrollment figures directly to neighboring districts without accounting for differences in grade configurations, alternative programs, or how charter school students are counted. Always ask what is and isn't included in an enrollment number before drawing conclusions.

### Schools in the District

Springfield SD 19 operates a comprehensive system of elementary, middle, and high schools, along with alternative education programs. The table below provides an overview of the district's schools (as of the most recent available data). Enrollment figures are approximate and fluctuate year to year.

#### High Schools

| School | Approximate Enrollment | Title I | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Springfield High School | ~1,200–1,400 | No | Comprehensive high school; downtown Springfield |
| Thurston High School | ~1,200–1,400 | No | Comprehensive high school; eastern Springfield/Thurston area |

#### Middle Schools

| School | Approximate Enrollment | Title I | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hamlin Middle School | ~500–600 | Yes | Central Springfield |
| Briggs Middle School | ~500–600 | Yes | Gateway/north Springfield area |
| Agnes Stewart Middle School | ~400–500 | Yes | South Springfield/Goshen area |

#### Elementary Schools

| Thurston Elementary | ~400–450 | No | Thurston area |
| Two Rivers–Dos Ríos Elementary | ~350–400 | Yes | Dual-language (English/Spanish) program |
| Walterville Elementary | ~150–200 | No | Rural — Walterville community |
| Yolanda Elementary | ~300–350 | Yes | South Springfield |

#### Alternative and Specialized Programs

| Program | Notes |
|---|---|
| Springfield Academy of Arts and Academics (A3) | Public alternative option emphasizing arts integration |
| Springfield Options Program | Alternative education for at-risk students |
| Early Childhood / Pre-K programs | Head Start partnership, district-operated preschool |

> **💡 Tip:** Title I status is determined annually based on the percentage of students qualifying for free and reduced-price meals. The majority of Springfield's elementary and middle schools qualify — this means they receive additional federal funding under Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), but it also signals the level of economic need in the community.

### District Mission, Vision, and Strategic Plan

Springfield Public Schools' mission centers on ensuring that all students graduate prepared for college, career, and civic life. While specific mission and vision language is updated periodically by the board and superintendent, the district's core commitments have consistently emphasized:

- **Equity** — ensuring that race, income, language, disability, and geography do not predict student outcomes
- **Academic excellence** — high expectations for all learners with the supports needed to meet them
- **Community engagement** — meaningful partnerships with families, local organizations, and civic institutions
- **Whole-child development** — attending to students' social, emotional, and physical well-being alongside academic growth

The district's **strategic plan** is the board's primary tool for translating mission into action. The strategic plan typically operates on a 3–5 year cycle and includes measurable goals in areas such as:

- Graduation rates and dropout prevention
- Third-grade reading proficiency
- Closing achievement and opportunity gaps by race and income
- Expanding career and technical education (CTE) pathways
- Improving school climate and reducing exclusionary discipline

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some new board members arrive wanting to set the district's direction immediately. Remember that the strategic plan is a *board* document — it reflects the collective priorities of the full board, developed in partnership with the superintendent and with community input. Changing strategic direction is a deliberative, public process, not something a single member can unilaterally drive.

### Organizational Structure

Springfield SD 19 is organized in a hierarchical structure with clear lines of authority flowing from the elected board through the superintendent to all district employees.

**Board of Directors** → **Superintendent** → **Cabinet / Executive Leadership Team** → **Principals and Department Directors** → **Teachers, Classified Staff, and Support Personnel**

Key leadership positions in the district typically include:

- **Superintendent** — chief executive officer; the board's only direct employee
- **Deputy / Assistant Superintendent(s)** — oversees instructional programs and/or operations
- **Chief Financial Officer (CFO) / Business Manager** — manages the district's finances, budgeting, and reporting
- **Director of Human Resources** — oversees hiring, labor relations, and personnel management
- **Director of Student Services** — special education, student health, counseling, and support programs
- **Director of Teaching and Learning** — curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development
- **Director of Facilities and Operations** — buildings, grounds, maintenance, transportation, and nutrition services
- **Director of Communications / Community Relations** — public information, media relations, and family engagement
- **Building Principals** — lead individual schools; report to the superintendent or assistant superintendent

> **💡 Tip:** As a board member, you interact officially with *one* employee: the superintendent. All requests for information, concerns about operations, or questions about individual schools should be routed through the superintendent's office. This is not bureaucracy — it is essential to maintaining clear lines of authority and allowing the superintendent to manage effectively. See ORS 332.505 (superintendent as executive officer).

---

### Budget Overview

Springfield SD 19 operates on an annual budget with a **general fund** of approximately **$130–$145 million** (as of the most recent available data). The general fund covers the core operations of the district — instruction, administration, support services, and maintenance. In addition to the general fund, the district manages several special funds, including federal grants, food service, transportation, capital construction, and debt service funds. The total of all funds may approach or exceed $180–$200 million.

#### Revenue Sources

| Source | Approximate Share | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| State School Fund (SSF) | ~55–60% | Oregon's primary K–12 funding mechanism; distributed per-pupil via the funding formula |
| Local property taxes | ~25–30% | Includes permanent rate levy and any local option levies approved by voters |
| Federal funds | ~8–12% | Title I, IDEA (special education), ESSER (COVID-era, phasing out), nutrition programs |
| Other sources | ~3–5% | Fees, intermediate sources (ESD), state grants, donations |

#### Major Expenditures

| Category | Approximate Share | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Personnel (salaries + benefits) | ~83–87% | Largest single cost; includes certified and classified staff |
| Purchased services | ~5–7% | Contracts, utilities, professional services |
| Supplies and materials | ~3–5% | Textbooks, instructional materials, technology |
| Capital outlay | ~1–3% | Equipment, minor construction (major construction is bonded separately) |
| Other | ~1–2% | Insurance, transfers, contingencies |

The overwhelming dominance of personnel costs is a critical fact for board members to understand. When the board discusses "cutting the budget," it is almost always talking about cutting *people* — teachers, aides, custodians, counselors. There is no large pool of non-personnel spending to draw from. Conversely, when the board adds programs or services, it is almost always adding staff positions and the associated salary and benefit costs.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** New board members sometimes assume the district has significant discretionary spending that can be redirected. In reality, the vast majority of the budget is consumed by salaries and benefits governed by collective bargaining agreements, and much of the remaining spending is committed to fixed costs like utilities, insurance, and debt service. Truly discretionary spending is a small fraction of the total budget.

#### Oregon's School Funding System

Oregon funds K–12 education primarily through the **State School Fund (SSF)**, which is distributed to districts based on a weighted pupil formula. Each student generates a base amount of funding, with additional weights for students who are:

- English Language Learners (ELL)
- Economically disadvantaged (eligible for free/reduced meals)
- Students with disabilities
- Students in foster care or experiencing homelessness
- Students in small or remote schools

The SSF is funded by the state General Fund (income taxes) and the statewide education property tax. The total amount is set biennially by the Oregon Legislature. The adequacy of this funding — whether the total SSF appropriation is sufficient to provide a quality education — has been a persistent source of tension between school districts and the legislature. The Quality Education Model (QEM), maintained by the Quality Education Commission, estimates the cost of providing a quality education in Oregon and consistently finds that actual funding falls short.

### Collective Bargaining Units

Springfield SD 19's workforce is represented by several collective bargaining units. Understanding the labor landscape is essential for board members because collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) govern salaries, benefits, working conditions, and grievance procedures for the majority of district employees.

- **Springfield Education Association (SEA)** — affiliated with the Oregon Education Association (OEA) and the National Education Association (NEA). Represents licensed/certificated staff including teachers, counselors, librarians, and specialists. The SEA is the largest bargaining unit in the district.
- **Classified employees' union** — represents support staff including paraeducators (instructional assistants), custodians, food service workers, bus drivers, and office staff. May be affiliated with the Oregon School Employees Association (OSEA) or another labor organization.
- **Administrators** — principals and assistant principals may be represented by a separate bargaining unit or association.
- **Confidential and supervisory employees** — a smaller group of employees who are excluded from other bargaining units due to their roles in labor relations or management.

The board does not directly negotiate contracts — that is the superintendent's responsibility (or that of designated labor-relations staff). However, the board **ratifies** all collective bargaining agreements. This means you will vote to approve or reject negotiated contracts, and you should understand the financial and operational implications of what has been negotiated. Under Oregon's Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA, ORS Chapter 243), both parties are required to bargain in good faith.

> **💡 Tip:** Ask the superintendent or HR director for a briefing on the current status and key terms of each collective bargaining agreement early in your tenure. Understanding salary schedules, step-and-column movement, health insurance costs, and class-size provisions will make budget discussions far more meaningful.

### Key District Programs

Springfield SD 19 offers a range of programs designed to meet the diverse needs of its student population:

#### Dual-Language Education
Two Rivers–Dos Ríos Elementary operates a **two-way dual-language immersion program** in English and Spanish. In this model, native English speakers and native Spanish speakers learn together in both languages, with the goal of bilingualism and biliteracy for all students. Dual-language programs are supported by research as among the most effective models for English Language Learners and provide significant cognitive benefits for all participants.

#### Career and Technical Education (CTE)
Both Springfield High School and Thurston High School offer CTE pathways in fields such as health sciences, engineering/manufacturing, information technology, culinary arts, and agriculture. CTE programs are funded through a combination of state Perkins Act grants, district general fund, and partnerships with local employers. The state requires CTE programs to align with industry standards and lead to recognized certifications where applicable (ORS 344.745).

#### Talented and Gifted (TAG)
Oregon law (ORS 343.391–ORS 343.413) requires school districts to identify and serve students who are talented and gifted. Springfield SD 19 operates a TAG program that includes identification through standardized testing and teacher/parent referral, differentiated instruction in the regular classroom, and enrichment opportunities such as pull-out programs and acceleration.

#### Title I Programs
The majority of Springfield's elementary and middle schools receive **Title I, Part A** funding under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Title I funds support additional instructional staff, intervention programs, parent engagement activities, and professional development. Title I schools are required to develop school improvement plans and meet federal accountability standards.

#### Alternative Education
Springfield provides alternative education options for students who are not thriving in traditional school settings. These include the Springfield Options Program and community-based partnerships. Oregon law (ORS 336.615–336.665) requires districts to provide alternative education options and to identify students who may benefit from them.

---

### Special Education

Springfield SD 19 operates one of the more independent special education programs among Lane County districts. While many smaller districts in the region contract with **Lane Education Service District (Lane ESD)** to provide some or all special education services, Springfield has historically maintained significant in-house capacity for special education programming, staffing, and compliance.

The district serves students with disabilities under the **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)** and Oregon's special education statutes (ORS Chapter 343). Services include:

- Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) developed by school-based teams
- Resource rooms, self-contained classrooms, and inclusion models
- Related services: speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, school psychology
- Transition services for students ages 16–21
- Early childhood special education (ECSE) for children ages 3–5

Special education is one of the most legally complex areas of school district operations. Board members should be aware that IDEA is a federal mandate — the district *must* provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to every eligible student regardless of cost. Federal and state funding covers only a portion of the actual cost of special education services, with the remainder borne by the district's general fund. This structural underfunding is a significant financial challenge for Springfield and virtually every district in Oregon.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes ask why special education costs so much or suggest capping spending. Federal law does not allow this — the district must provide whatever services are specified in a student's IEP, even if they are extraordinarily expensive. The board's role is to ensure the district is well-managed and compliant, not to second-guess individual IEP decisions.

---

### Facilities and Bond History

Springfield SD 19 maintains a large and aging portfolio of school buildings. Many of the district's facilities were constructed in the 1950s through 1970s during a period of rapid enrollment growth. Maintaining, modernizing, and replacing these buildings is one of the board's most consequential long-term responsibilities.

Major facilities funding comes through **general obligation (GO) bonds**, which must be approved by voters. Bond measures require a "double majority" in Oregon (a majority of votes cast, with turnout exceeding 50% of registered voters) for elections held outside of regular November general elections — although this requirement does not apply to November elections (ORS 250.175).

Key facilities considerations for the district include:

- **Seismic readiness** — many older buildings were not built to modern seismic standards; Oregon's earthquake risk makes this a serious life-safety concern
- **HVAC and energy efficiency** — older heating and cooling systems are expensive to operate and often inadequate
- **ADA compliance** — ensuring all facilities are accessible to students, staff, and community members with disabilities
- **Capacity alignment** — matching building capacity to actual enrollment in each attendance area
- **Technology infrastructure** — ensuring schools have adequate network capacity, electrical power, and device support for modern instruction
- **Deferred maintenance** — the accumulated backlog of maintenance projects that have been postponed due to funding constraints

The district has historically passed bond measures to fund major construction and renovation projects. Voters' willingness to support bonds is a reflection of community confidence in the district — which makes the board's stewardship of bond funds a particularly high-visibility responsibility.

### Demographics vs. State Averages

Springfield SD 19's student body reflects the community's economic and demographic profile, which differs in important ways from statewide averages:

| Metric | Springfield SD 19 (est.) | Oregon Statewide Average |
|---|---|---|
| Free/Reduced-Price Lunch Eligible | ~60–65% | ~48–52% |
| English Language Learners | ~12–15% | ~10–12% |
| Students with Disabilities (IEP) | ~14–16% | ~14–15% |
| Students of Color | ~30–35% | ~38–42% |
| Hispanic/Latino Students | ~20–25% | ~25–27% |
| Four-Year Graduation Rate | ~78–83% | ~82–85% |

*(Figures are approximate, based on the most recent publicly available data from the Oregon Department of Education and NCES.)*

The most significant takeaway is the district's **high rate of economic disadvantage**. Nearly two-thirds of Springfield's students qualify for free or reduced-price meals — substantially higher than the state average. This has profound implications for the resources needed to support students, the types of programs the district prioritizes, and the challenges teachers and staff face daily.

> **💡 Tip:** When reviewing data, always disaggregate by subgroup. District averages can mask significant disparities. Ask to see graduation rates, test scores, and discipline data broken down by race, income, disability status, and English-learner status. This is not just good practice — it is a requirement under Oregon's accountability framework and the board's equity commitments.

---

### Challenges Facing the District

Every district faces challenges, but Springfield's mix is shaped by its particular community context:

- **Enrollment trends** — like many non-metro Oregon districts, Springfield has experienced flat or slightly declining enrollment. Each student lost represents approximately $10,000–$11,000 in State School Fund revenue, so even modest enrollment declines have significant budget impact.
- **Funding adequacy** — Oregon's K–12 funding system has been chronically below the level the Quality Education Commission identifies as necessary. Springfield, with its high-need student population, feels this gap acutely.
- **Staffing shortages** — recruiting and retaining teachers, special education staff, bus drivers, and classified employees is an ongoing challenge, particularly given competition from neighboring districts (Eugene 4J, Bethel SD) and cost-of-living pressures.
- **Mental health and behavioral needs** — the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a pre-existing trend of increasing student mental health needs. Springfield's schools serve as a de facto mental health safety net for many families.
- **Chronic absenteeism** — a statewide challenge that is particularly acute in high-poverty districts. Students who miss 10% or more of school days (approximately 18 days per year) are classified as chronically absent, and Springfield's rates have historically exceeded state averages.
- **Facilities aging** — the ongoing cost of maintaining and modernizing buildings that are 50–70 years old.
- **Equity gaps** — persistent disparities in outcomes by race, income, and disability status that the district is working to close.
- **ESSER fiscal cliff** — federal COVID-era relief funds (Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief) provided significant temporary resources that have now expired, creating budget pressure as those programs and positions are no longer funded.

---

### Community Partners

Springfield SD 19 does not operate in isolation. The district relies on a network of community partnerships to serve students and families:

- **Lane Community College (LCC)** — dual-credit and College Now programs that allow high school students to earn college credits; CTE partnerships; adult education and GED programs
- **University of Oregon (UO)** — student-teacher placements, research partnerships, and community engagement programs
- **PeaceHealth** — school-based health services and wellness programming
- **United Way of Lane County** — coordinated support for students and families, including the READY! for Kindergarten program
- **Food for Lane County** — weekend food backpack programs, summer meal sites
- **Local employers** — CTE internships, job shadows, and career exploration partnerships
- **Lane Education Service District (Lane ESD)** — professional development, technology services, specialized support (though Springfield operates much of its own special education programming)
- **City of Springfield** — coordination on safe routes to school, park access, recreation programs, and community safety
- **Springfield Education Foundation** — local nonprofit supporting grants for classroom innovation and student programs

---

### How the Board Relates to District Operations

A recurring theme throughout this training: the board governs, the superintendent manages. In the specific context of Springfield SD 19, this means:

- The board **sets policy** — the district operates under a comprehensive set of board policies (often based on Oregon School Boards Association templates) that govern everything from curriculum adoption to student discipline to purchasing thresholds.
- The board **approves the budget** — after a public process including a budget committee (composed of board members and community appointees), the board adopts the annual budget and appropriates funds.
- The board **hires and evaluates the superintendent** — this is the board's most important personnel decision and its single most powerful management tool.
- The board **approves collective bargaining agreements** — negotiated by the superintendent's team, ratified by the board.
- The board **sets strategic direction** — through the strategic plan, board goals, and policy priorities.
- The board **serves as a court of appeals** — for employee grievances and student expulsions that have exhausted administrative remedies.
- The board **represents the community** — listening to constituents, communicating district priorities, and building public trust.

What the board does **not** do:

- Hire, evaluate, or direct any employee other than the superintendent
- Make day-to-day operational decisions
- Intervene in individual student discipline cases (unless properly appealed)
- Direct the superintendent to take specific operational actions outside the policy framework
- Represent the board unilaterally — individual members speak for themselves, not the board, unless authorized

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** It is tempting, especially when a constituent contacts you with a specific problem, to try to "fix it" by calling the school or directing a staff member. This undermines the chain of command and can create significant governance problems. The correct response is to forward the concern to the superintendent and trust the administrative team to address it — then follow up to make sure it was resolved.
