## Overview

If Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) are the "what" of education law — telling school districts what they must do, what they may do, and what they are prohibited from doing — then Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs) are the "how." OAR Chapter 581 is the comprehensive body of administrative rules governing public education in Oregon, adopted and maintained by the State Board of Education and the Oregon Department of Education (ODE). These rules translate broad statutory mandates into specific, operational requirements that touch virtually every aspect of school district operations: graduation standards, instructional time, special education, school finance, teacher licensing, student conduct, school safety, and much more.

For new board members, a critical early lesson is understanding the hierarchy of law that governs your district. At the top sits the Oregon Constitution and federal law. Below that are Oregon Revised Statutes enacted by the Legislature. Below statutes sit Oregon Administrative Rules adopted by state agencies. And at the bottom — constrained by all three layers above — are local board policies. OARs carry the full force and effect of law. They are not suggestions, guidelines, or best practices. When an OAR establishes a requirement, your district must comply, and the consequences for non-compliance can be severe: corrective action, loss of state funding, increased state oversight, and public embarrassment.

OAR Chapter 581 is enormous — spanning dozens of divisions and hundreds of individual rules. No board member is expected to memorize it. But every board member should understand its structure, know where to find the rules most relevant to board decisions, and appreciate the regulatory framework within which the superintendent and staff operate daily. This module provides that foundation.

### What Are OARs and How Do They Differ from Statutes?

Oregon Administrative Rules are regulations adopted by state agencies under authority delegated by the Legislature. The distinction between statutes and rules is fundamental:

| Feature | Statutes (ORS) | Administrative Rules (OAR) |
|---|---|---|
| Created by | Oregon Legislature | State agencies (ODE, State Board of Education) |
| Process | Legislative session, committee hearings, floor votes, Governor's signature | Agency rulemaking: notice, public comment, adoption |
| Scope | Broad mandates and authority grants | Detailed operational requirements |
| Flexibility | Changed only by the Legislature | Agencies can update between legislative sessions |
| Force of law | Yes | Yes — carries the same legal weight as statute |
| Example | ORS 329.045 requires the State Board to adopt academic content standards | OAR 581-022-2030 specifies the actual essential skills students must demonstrate |

**Why the distinction matters for board members:** Statutes change only when the Legislature is in session and passes a bill. OARs can be updated at any time through the rulemaking process, meaning the regulatory landscape can shift between legislative sessions. A board member who tracks only statutory changes may miss significant rule changes that affect district operations.

> **💡 Tip:** Subscribe to ODE's rulemaking notification list (available on the ODE website) to receive alerts when proposed rules are published for public comment. This gives your district the opportunity to weigh in on rules before they are finalized.

### The Rulemaking Process: How OARs Are Created and Changed

Understanding how OARs are made demystifies the regulatory process and reveals opportunities for board members to influence the rules that govern their districts.

**Step-by-step rulemaking process:**

1. **Statutory authority identified:** Every OAR must be traceable to a specific statute that authorizes the agency to adopt rules on the subject. For education rules, this authority typically comes from ORS 326.051 (State Board of Education powers) or specific statutes like ORS 329.045 (academic standards).

2. **Fiscal impact statement:** Before proposing a rule, ODE must prepare a fiscal impact statement estimating the costs to state and local government, businesses, and the public. For school districts, this often reveals the unfunded or partially funded mandates embedded in proposed rules.

3. **Notice of proposed rulemaking:** ODE publishes a formal notice in the Oregon Bulletin (Secretary of State) and distributes it to stakeholders on its mailing list. The notice includes the text of the proposed rule, the statutory authority, and the timeline for public comment.

4. **Public comment period:** A minimum 21-day comment period allows anyone — including school board members, administrators, parents, and organizations like OSBA — to submit written comments. ODE may also hold a public hearing.

5. **Agency review:** ODE reviews all comments, may revise the proposed rule, and prepares a response summary.

6. **Adoption:** The State Board of Education votes to adopt the final rule. The rule is filed with the Secretary of State and published in the Oregon Administrative Rules Compilation.

7. **Effective date:** Rules typically take effect on the date specified in the filing, often 30 days after adoption.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Many district leaders assume that rulemaking is a "Salem process" they cannot influence. In reality, public comment periods are one of the most effective opportunities to shape education policy. OSBA regularly coordinates comments from member districts. Your voice matters — use it.

### Structure of OAR Chapter 581

OAR Chapter 581 is organized into numbered divisions, each addressing a distinct area of education regulation. The divisions most critical for school board members are:

| Division | Subject Area | Why It Matters to the Board |
|---|---|---|
| Division 15 | State Board of Education — Organization | Governs the State Board's own procedures; rarely relevant to local boards directly |
| Division 21 | School District Governance and Student Conduct | Rules on board organization, student discipline, attendance, records |
| Division 22 | Standards for Public Elementary and Secondary Schools | Minimum standards for instruction, curriculum, graduation, assessment — the regulatory backbone |
| Division 23 | School Finance | Budget, accounting, audit, financial reporting requirements |
| Division 24 | Special Education | Rules implementing IDEA and Oregon special education statutes |
| Division 37 | Charter Schools | Requirements for charter school authorization and oversight |
| Division 53 | Transportation | School bus safety, driver qualifications, vehicle standards |

Understanding this structure allows you to quickly locate the division relevant to a particular governance question. When your superintendent references "Division 22 compliance," you will know they are talking about instructional standards. When your business manager mentions "Division 23 reporting," you will know they are talking about financial obligations to the state.

---

### Division 21 — School District Governance and Student Conduct

Division 21 addresses the internal governance of school districts and the framework for student conduct policies. Key rules include:

**OAR 581-021-0009 through 581-021-0036 — District governance procedures:**
These rules establish requirements for how district boards organize their proceedings, conduct meetings, and maintain records. They supplement (but do not replace) the Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610–192.695).

**OAR 581-021-0050 through 581-021-0075 — Student discipline:**
These rules set the minimum due process requirements for student suspensions, expulsions, and alternative discipline. They require districts to adopt written conduct codes, provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before imposing discipline, and ensure that discipline policies are applied equitably.

**OAR 581-021-0110 — Attendance and truancy:**
Establishes the framework for compulsory attendance enforcement, including the process for referring truant students to county juvenile departments. This rule interacts with ORS 339.010–339.090 (compulsory attendance statutes).

**Board relevance:** Division 21 rules directly shape your district's student handbook and conduct code. When parents challenge a disciplinary decision, the adequacy of your district's due process procedures under Division 21 will be scrutinized. Boards should ensure their policies meet or exceed these minimum requirements.

> **💡 Tip:** Have your superintendent provide the board with an annual summary of student discipline data, disaggregated by race, gender, and disability status. Division 21 requires equitable discipline — and disproportionality in suspension/expulsion rates is an increasingly common area of state scrutiny and federal civil rights concern.

---

### Division 22 — Standards for Public Elementary and Secondary Schools

Division 22 is the single most important regulatory division for school board members. It establishes the **minimum standards** that every Oregon public school must meet and is the basis for ODE's compliance monitoring of school districts.

#### OAR 581-022-2000 — Diploma Requirements (Graduation Standards)

This rule specifies the credit requirements and essential skills that students must demonstrate to earn an Oregon diploma. As of the 2025–2026 school year, the requirements include:

**Credit requirements:**
- 24 total credits for a standard diploma
- English Language Arts: 4 credits
- Mathematics: 3 credits (including Algebra I or equivalent)
- Science: 3 credits
- Social Studies: 3 credits (including U.S. History, Government/Civics, Economics, and Global Studies)
- Physical Education: 1 credit
- Health: 1 credit
- Career and Technical Education, Arts, or Second Language: 3 credits
- Electives: 6 credits

**Essential skills:** Students must demonstrate proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics through approved assessment options. The 2024–2025 legislative session brought significant changes to essential skill requirements, with the Legislature revisiting standardized assessment mandates following pandemic-era suspensions.

**Modified and extended diplomas:** OAR 581-022-2000 also addresses modified diplomas (for students with disabilities who meet adjusted requirements) and extended diplomas (for students who continue in school beyond four years). Board members should understand these pathways because they affect graduation rate calculations and the district's obligation to serve students with individualized needs.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes conflate credit requirements with graduation. A student may earn 24 credits but still not graduate if they have not demonstrated essential skills. Conversely, a student on a modified diploma pathway may graduate with fewer credits. Understand the full picture, not just the credit count.

#### OAR 581-022-2320 — Instructional Time Requirements

This rule establishes the minimum hours of instruction that districts must provide annually:

| Grade Level | Minimum Annual Instructional Hours |
|---|---|
| Kindergarten | 450 hours (half-day) or 900 hours (full-day) |
| Grades 1–8 | 900 hours |
| Grades 9–12 | 990 hours |

**What counts as instructional time:** Classroom instruction, supervised study, testing (state and local assessments), and certain approved activities (field trips with an instructional component, assemblies tied to the curriculum). Passing time, lunch, and recess generally do not count.

**What does not count:** Teacher in-service days, parent-teacher conference days, snow days (unless instruction is delivered remotely under an approved plan), and administrative days.

**Board relevance:** The school calendar approved by the board must ensure compliance with instructional time minimums. When considering early-release schedules, late-start days for professional development, or weather closures, the superintendent must track cumulative instructional time and report to the board on whether the district is on pace to meet the requirement.

> **💡 Tip:** Ask your superintendent to provide a running count of instructional hours at mid-year (January) and again in March. If the district is behind pace — due to snow days, emergency closures, or other disruptions — the board can take early action (such as extending the school year or converting in-service days) rather than scrambling in June.

#### OAR 581-022-2030 — Essential Skills

This rule defines the essential skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and application of mathematics) that students must demonstrate for graduation. It also specifies the approved assessment options, which may include standardized tests, work samples, and locally developed assessments. The State Board has repeatedly revised the essential skills framework since 2020, and the 2025–2026 rules reflect the latest revisions to assessment options following legislative action in 2024.

#### OAR 581-022-2050 — Required Instructional Programs

This rule requires every district to provide instruction in a comprehensive list of subject areas, including:

- English Language Arts and Mathematics
- Science (including Next Generation Science Standards alignment)
- Social Studies (including civics, economics, geography, and history)
- Physical Education and Health
- Career and Technical Education
- Arts (visual, performing, or applied)
- Second Languages
- Financial Literacy (added by the Legislature in 2023)

Districts have local discretion in how they deliver these programs, but they must offer them. A district that eliminates an entire program area — for example, cutting all arts education due to budget constraints — would be in violation of Division 22.

---

### Division 23 — School Finance

Division 23 translates the financial management requirements of Oregon Local Budget Law (ORS 294) and the State School Fund (ORS 327) into detailed operational rules for school districts.

**Key rules include:**

**OAR 581-023-0100 through 581-023-0240 — Budget preparation and adoption:**
These rules specify the format, content, and procedures for district budgets, including requirements for the budget committee process, public hearings, and submission of the adopted budget to the county assessor and ODE.

**OAR 581-023-0400 through 581-023-0450 — Accounting and financial reporting:**
Districts must follow the Oregon School Districts Accounting Manual, which establishes the chart of accounts, fund structure, and financial reporting formats. These rules ensure statewide consistency in financial reporting and enable ODE to aggregate and compare financial data across districts.

**OAR 581-023-0500 through 581-023-0550 — Auditing:**
Every district must undergo an annual financial audit conducted by an independent auditor in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. The audit report must be submitted to the Secretary of State's Division of Audits and to ODE. Material audit findings — particularly those related to financial controls, fund balance deficiencies, or compliance failures — should be reported to the board and addressed promptly.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some board members assume that if the annual audit is "clean" (unqualified opinion), the district has no financial issues. An unqualified opinion means the financial statements are fairly presented — it does not mean the district is financially healthy, well-managed, or free of compliance issues. Read the management letter and any findings carefully.

---

### Division 24 — Special Education

Division 24 implements the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Oregon's special education statutes (ORS 343) through detailed administrative rules. Key areas include:

- **Child find:** Districts must identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities residing within the district (OAR 581-015-2080)
- **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs):** Detailed requirements for IEP development, content, implementation, and review (OAR 581-015-2200 through 581-015-2230)
- **Least restrictive environment:** Students with disabilities must be educated with non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate (OAR 581-015-2240)
- **Procedural safeguards:** Parents' rights to notice, consent, evaluation, dispute resolution, and due process hearings (OAR 581-015-2300 through 581-015-2385)
- **Discipline of students with disabilities:** Specific rules that supplement general discipline rules, including manifestation determinations and protections against removal (OAR 581-015-2410 through 581-015-2440)

**Board relevance:** Special education is one of the highest-risk areas for school districts — both financially and legally. Federal and state law create enforceable individual rights for students with disabilities, and the cost of non-compliance (including compensatory education awards, legal fees, and corrective action) can be significant. The board should receive regular reports on special education enrollment, expenditures, compliance audits, and dispute resolution activity.

> **💡 Tip:** Request a special education "dashboard" from your superintendent at least twice per year, covering: (1) number of students served, (2) total special education expenditure vs. federal and state reimbursement, (3) any pending due process complaints or state complaints, and (4) results of the most recent ODE special education compliance review.

### How OARs Affect Daily Board Decisions

OARs are not abstract regulations that live in a filing cabinet in Salem. They affect the board's work in concrete, everyday ways. Here are examples:

**Calendar approval:** When the board approves the school calendar, it must ensure compliance with OAR 581-022-2320 (instructional time). The superintendent builds the calendar to meet the hourly minimums, and the board reviews it with that compliance framework in mind.

**Budget deliberations:** When the board reviews the proposed budget, Division 23 rules dictate the format of the budget document, the fund structure, and the required disclosures. The budget committee process itself is governed by OAR and ORS 294.

**Policy adoption:** When the board adopts or revises a policy — say, on student discipline — it must ensure the policy meets the minimum due process requirements of Division 21. A discipline policy that falls below OAR standards is not just bad practice; it is unlawful.

**Graduation ceremonies:** When the board celebrates graduating seniors, Division 22 rules determine which students have met the requirements for a diploma. A student who has not demonstrated essential skills under OAR 581-022-2030 has not met graduation requirements, regardless of how many credits they have earned.

**Hiring decisions:** While the board itself typically hires only the superintendent, the district's hiring practices for teachers must comply with teacher licensing rules under OAR 584 (administered by the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission, or TSPC). The board should ensure the superintendent has systems in place to verify that every teacher holds a valid Oregon license.

---

### When OARs Override Local Policy vs. Local Discretion

One of the most important distinctions for board members to grasp is the boundary between state regulatory requirements and local discretion. The framework is:

1. **OARs set the floor, not the ceiling.** Your district must meet all OAR minimum requirements. You may exceed them — for example, requiring more credits for graduation than the state minimum — but you may not go below them.

2. **OARs are mandatory where they use "shall" or "must."** When a rule states that a district "shall" do something, it is a non-discretionary requirement. When a rule states that a district "may" do something, it is permissive — the board has discretion.

3. **Local policy fills the gaps.** Many OARs establish a framework but leave implementation details to local discretion. For example, OAR 581-022-2050 requires districts to offer instruction in the arts, but does not specify which art forms, how many courses, or at what grade levels. Those decisions are yours.

4. **Local policy cannot contradict OARs.** If a board adopts a policy that conflicts with an OAR, the OAR prevails. The policy would be unenforceable — and the district would be out of compliance.

**Practical example:**

| Area | OAR Requirement | Local Discretion |
|---|---|---|
| Graduation credits | Minimum 24 credits (OAR 581-022-2000) | District may require more than 24 |
| Instructional time (9–12) | Minimum 990 hours/year (OAR 581-022-2320) | District may provide more than 990 hours |
| Student discipline | Due process notice and hearing required (OAR 581-021-0065) | District designs its own hearing procedures, as long as they meet the minimum |
| Curriculum | Must offer instruction in specified subject areas (OAR 581-022-2050) | District selects specific courses, textbooks, and instructional methods |
| Financial reporting | Must follow prescribed accounting format (OAR 581-023-0400) | No discretion — format is standardized |

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Boards occasionally adopt policies that unintentionally conflict with OARs — often because the board is relying on an outdated policy manual or drafting policy without legal review. Every significant policy adoption or revision should be reviewed by the board attorney or OSBA policy services for OAR compliance.

---

### How to Look Up OARs

Board members do not need to memorize OAR Chapter 581, but they should know how to find what they need:

**Secretary of State — Oregon Administrative Rules Database:**
The official, authoritative source for all Oregon Administrative Rules. Available at https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/oregon_administrative_rules.aspx. You can browse by chapter (581 for Education) and division, or search by keyword or rule number.

**Oregon Public Law (oregon.public.law):**
A user-friendly, searchable third-party website that presents OARs with helpful formatting and cross-references. Easier to navigate than the official database for quick lookups, but always verify against the official source for critical decisions.

**ODE Rules Division Reference:**
ODE maintains a reference page on its website that organizes Chapter 581 rules by division, with plain-language summaries. This is the best starting point for a board member who knows the topic but not the specific rule number.

> **💡 Tip:** When your superintendent or board attorney references a specific OAR in a board packet or presentation, take 60 seconds to look it up on oregon.public.law. Reading the actual rule — even briefly — builds your regulatory fluency and helps you ask better questions.

---

### Recent OAR Changes (2024–2026)

The regulatory landscape for Oregon education has been particularly active in the 2024–2026 period. Key developments include:

**Graduation requirements overhaul (2024–2025):**
The State Board of Education adopted significant revisions to OAR 581-022-2000 and related rules following legislative direction in the 2024 session. Changes include revised essential skill assessment options, updates to modified diploma eligibility criteria, and new financial literacy requirements. Districts were required to update their graduation policies by the 2025–2026 school year.

**Instructional time flexibility (2025):**
Following pandemic-era experimentation with remote learning and flexible scheduling, ODE adopted rule amendments to OAR 581-022-2320 providing greater flexibility in how districts count instructional time, including provisions for approved hybrid learning models and expanded definitions of supervised instructional activities.

**Student mental health and safety (2024–2026):**
New and amended rules in Division 22 address school safety planning, student mental health screening, suicide prevention training for staff, and threat assessment procedures. These rules reflect legislative priorities from the 2023 and 2024 sessions (including SB 555 and HB 2867).

**Equity-focused discipline (2025):**
Amendments to Division 21 discipline rules strengthen requirements for restorative justice practices, limit the use of exclusionary discipline (suspension and expulsion) for non-violent offenses, and require annual reporting of discipline data disaggregated by race, gender, disability status, and other protected categories.

**Special education updates (2024–2025):**
Division 24 rules were amended to align with federal regulatory changes under IDEA, including revisions to evaluation timelines, transition planning requirements, and procedural safeguard notices. These changes affect IEP team procedures and parent notification requirements.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes rely on their recollection of rules from when they first joined the board. OARs change more frequently than statutes. Make it a habit to review the "What's New" section on ODE's website at least quarterly, and direct your superintendent to provide a regulatory update at least twice per year.

---

### Compliance Audits and Consequences

ODE monitors district compliance with OAR Chapter 581 through several mechanisms:

**Division 22 compliance reviews:**
ODE conducts periodic reviews of districts' compliance with Division 22 standards. These reviews may be routine (on a cycle) or triggered by a complaint. The review examines whether the district meets minimum instructional time, offers required programs, meets graduation standards, and complies with special education requirements.

**Annual financial audits:**
As required by Division 23, every district undergoes an annual independent audit. Audit findings related to financial management, internal controls, or compliance are reported to the board and to ODE. Material findings may trigger corrective action.

**Special education compliance monitoring:**
ODE monitors districts' compliance with Division 24 special education rules through a combination of data reviews, on-site visits, and complaint investigations. Districts found in non-compliance are issued corrective action orders with specific timelines.

**Consequences of non-compliance:**

| Severity | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Minor technical finding | Written notice with timeline for correction |
| Repeated or material non-compliance | Formal corrective action plan (CAP) with ODE oversight |
| Failure to implement CAP | Withholding of state funds or reduction in state funding |
| Egregious or systemic non-compliance | State intervention under ORS 327.103, potentially including the appointment of a state oversight team |
| Special education non-compliance | Federal enforcement through IDEA mechanisms, including potential loss of federal funds |

> **💡 Tip:** When your district receives any compliance finding — however minor — ensure that the superintendent develops a corrective action plan, presents it to the board, and reports on implementation progress. A small finding left unaddressed can escalate into a serious compliance problem.

### How OARs Relate to Local Board Policy: A Practical Framework

The relationship between OARs and local board policy can be visualized as a layered system:

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|   Federal Law (IDEA, ESSA,                |
|   Title IX, Civil Rights)                 |
+-------------------------------------------+
|   Oregon Constitution                     |
+-------------------------------------------+
|   Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS)           |
+-------------------------------------------+
|   Oregon Administrative Rules    <-- OAR  |
|   (OAR)                          Ch. 581  |
+-------------------------------------------+
|   Local Board Policies  <-- Your policies |
+-------------------------------------------+
|   Administrative Procedures               |
|   (Superintendent implements)             |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

Each layer must be consistent with the layers above it. Your board policies cannot contradict OARs, which cannot contradict statutes, which cannot contradict the constitution.

**Practical policy development process:**

1. **Identify the need:** A new statute or OAR requires a policy update, or the board identifies a governance need.
2. **Research the regulatory framework:** Identify all applicable OARs and statutes. OSBA Policy Services provides model policies pre-mapped to relevant OARs.
3. **Draft the policy:** Working with the superintendent and/or OSBA, draft a policy that meets or exceeds OAR requirements.
4. **Legal review:** Have the board attorney review the draft for OAR compliance, statutory consistency, and constitutional adequacy.
5. **First reading and public input:** Present the draft at a public board meeting. Receive community input.
6. **Second reading and adoption:** After incorporating feedback, adopt the final policy by board vote.
7. **Implementation:** The superintendent develops administrative procedures to implement the policy and trains staff.
8. **Ongoing review:** Schedule periodic review to ensure the policy remains current with any OAR amendments.

> **💡 Tip:** OSBA Policy Services provides a subscription service that tracks OAR changes and flags policies in your manual that need updating. If your district subscribes, make sure your board receives a summary of recommended policy updates at least annually. If your district does not subscribe, consider it a worthwhile investment — the cost is modest compared to the legal risk of outdated policies.

---

### Key Takeaways for New Board Members

1. **OARs are law, not suggestions.** Administrative rules carry the same legal force as statutes. Non-compliance has real consequences, from corrective action to loss of funding.

2. **Division 22 is your regulatory backbone.** The minimum standards for instruction, curriculum, graduation, and assessment are all in Division 22. If you read one division of OAR Chapter 581, make it Division 22.

3. **The rulemaking process is your opportunity to influence policy.** Public comment periods on proposed rules are open to everyone — including board members and districts. Engage individually and through OSBA.

4. **OARs set the floor; local policy raises the bar.** Your district must meet all OAR minimums, but your board has discretion to exceed them. Use that discretion to reflect your community's values and priorities.

5. **Track regulatory changes actively.** OARs change more frequently than statutes. Subscribe to ODE notifications, attend OSBA conferences, and ask your superintendent for regular regulatory updates.

6. **Compliance is a board responsibility.** While the superintendent manages day-to-day compliance, the board is ultimately accountable for ensuring that the district meets all state and federal requirements. Ask for compliance reports, review audit findings, and follow up on corrective actions.

7. **Know where to look it up.** You do not need to memorize Chapter 581. But you should know how to navigate the Secretary of State's OAR database, the ODE rules reference page, and the oregon.public.law website so you can find answers when you need them.

> **💡 Tip:** At your next board meeting, ask the superintendent to provide a brief overview of the district's most recent Division 22 compliance status. This single question signals to your administration that the board takes regulatory compliance seriously — and it gives you a practical starting point for understanding how OARs shape your district's operations.
