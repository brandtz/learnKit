## Overview

While Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) establish the broad legal framework for public education, Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs) provide the detailed, operational regulations that tell school districts exactly how to comply with the law. OAR Chapter 581 is the comprehensive body of administrative rules governing education in Oregon, and it touches virtually every aspect of school district operations — from governance and student conduct to instructional standards and financial reporting.

OARs are developed and adopted by state agencies, primarily the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) and the State Board of Education, through a formal rulemaking process that includes public notice and comment. Unlike statutes, which are enacted by the Legislature, OARs are regulatory in nature — but they carry the full force of law. For school board members, understanding the distinction between statutes and rules is essential: statutes say *what* must happen, while OARs specify *how* it must happen.

Chapter 581 is organized into numbered divisions, each addressing a distinct area of education regulation. The divisions most relevant to school board governance include Division 21 (school governance and student conduct), Division 22 (standards for public elementary and secondary schools), and Division 23 (school finance). Together, these divisions form the regulatory backbone that shapes district policy, budgets, and accountability to the state.

For a new board member, familiarity with OAR Chapter 581 is critical because non-compliance can have serious consequences — including state intervention, corrective action plans, and the potential loss of state funding. The board's policy oversight role requires an understanding of which regulations apply to the district and how the administration ensures ongoing compliance.

## Key Concepts

### Division 21 — School Governance and Student Conduct

Division 21 of OAR Chapter 581 addresses the governance structure and operational procedures of Oregon school districts, as well as rules related to student conduct and discipline. This division provides detailed guidance on how boards must organize their proceedings, conduct business, and ensure that governance practices align with state requirements. It also sets out the framework for student rights and responsibilities, including discipline policies, attendance, and due process protections. Board members should understand that Division 21 rules directly influence the district's code of conduct policies and the procedures for handling student discipline matters — areas where board policy and state regulation must be carefully aligned.

### Division 22 — Standards for Public Elementary and Secondary Schools

Division 22 is perhaps the most significant regulatory division for school board members to understand, as it establishes the minimum standards that every public school in Oregon must meet. These standards cover a wide range of areas, including instructional time requirements, curriculum content, graduation requirements, assessment and testing, and special program mandates. Districts are required to demonstrate compliance with Division 22 standards through regular reporting to ODE. The board's role in ensuring Division 22 compliance is both strategic and fiduciary — the board must ensure that the district allocates sufficient resources and attention to meeting these baseline requirements, while also pursuing higher standards where possible.

### Division 23 — School Finance

Division 23 governs the financial operations of Oregon school districts, including budgeting, accounting, auditing, and financial reporting. These rules specify how districts must prepare and adopt their annual budgets, how funds must be classified and tracked, and what financial reports must be submitted to ODE. For board members, Division 23 is the regulatory foundation for the board's budget oversight responsibility. Understanding these rules helps board members ask informed questions during budget deliberations, evaluate financial reports, and ensure that the district's financial practices meet state standards. Non-compliance with Division 23 can trigger audit findings, corrective action, and potential impacts on state funding.

### Compliance Reporting Obligations to ODE

Oregon school districts are required to submit a variety of reports to the Oregon Department of Education throughout the year, covering academics, finance, staffing, student demographics, and special programs. These reporting obligations are established by OAR and are not optional — failure to report accurately and on time can result in sanctions, funding adjustments, or increased state oversight. Board members should understand the district's reporting calendar and the types of data that are submitted to ODE, as these reports often reflect the district's compliance posture and can surface areas that require board attention or policy action.

### How OARs Relate to Local Board Policy

One of the most important relationships in Oregon education governance is the connection between state administrative rules and local board policy. OARs set the regulatory floor — the minimum standards and requirements that every district must meet. Local board policies then build on that foundation, adapting state requirements to the specific context and priorities of the district. Board members should recognize that local policy cannot contradict or fall below OAR requirements, but it can exceed them. Effective policy governance requires the board to regularly review and update its policies to ensure alignment with current OARs, particularly when the State Board of Education adopts new or amended rules.
