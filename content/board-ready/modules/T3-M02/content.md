## Overview

The Board of Directors of Springfield School District 19 is the democratically elected governing body responsible for setting policy, approving budgets, and overseeing the education of approximately 10,000 students in Springfield, Oregon. Understanding the board's structure, how members are elected, how meetings are conducted, and how governance documents shape daily operations is foundational knowledge for any new or prospective board member.

This module provides an in-depth guide to the governance structure of Springfield's board — not just the theory of how boards operate (covered in Tier 1 and Tier 2 modules), but the specific, practical details of *this* board: its composition, its meeting schedule, its committees, its relationship with the superintendent, and the annual rhythm of its work. Governance is not abstract. It happens in a specific room, on a specific schedule, with specific people following specific rules. Knowing those details is what separates a prepared board member from one who is still figuring things out six months into their term.

Oregon law (ORS Chapter 332) establishes the legal framework for school board governance, but within that framework, each district's board develops its own culture, norms, and operational patterns. Springfield's board has its own character — shaped by decades of community history, leadership transitions, policy debates, and the evolving needs of the district. This module will help you understand both the formal structure and the informal culture of the board you are joining.

### Board Composition — Seven Members, Zone-Based Elections

Springfield SD 19 is governed by a **seven-member Board of Directors**. This is a larger board than some Oregon districts — many smaller districts operate with five members — and reflects Springfield's size and the geographic diversity of its service area.

The seven board positions are structured as follows:

- **Positions 1 through 5** — elected by voters within **five geographic zones** that divide the district's territory
- **Positions 6 and 7** — elected **at-large** by all voters within the district

All board members serve **four-year terms**, with elections staggered so that approximately half the board is up for election every two years. This staggering is deliberate — it ensures institutional continuity by preventing a complete turnover of the board in any single election cycle.

| Position | Type | Election Basis | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Position 1 | Zone | Zone 1 voters only | 4-year term |
| Position 2 | Zone | Zone 2 voters only | 4-year term |
| Position 3 | Zone | Zone 3 voters only | 4-year term |
| Position 4 | Zone | Zone 4 voters only | 4-year term |
| Position 5 | Zone | Zone 5 voters only | 4-year term |
| Position 6 | At-Large | All district voters | 4-year term |
| Position 7 | At-Large | All district voters | 4-year term |

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** New board members elected from a specific zone sometimes see themselves as "representing" only that zone's interests — like a city council member representing a ward. While you are elected by zone voters and should be responsive to their concerns, Oregon law is clear: once seated, every board member has a fiduciary duty to act in the interest of **all** students and the entire district. You are not a delegate for your zone; you are a trustee for the whole community.

### How Zone Elections Work in Springfield

Springfield's five zones are drawn to divide the district's geographic territory into roughly equal portions based on population. The zones are designed to ensure geographic representation so that different parts of the district — urban core, suburban neighborhoods, and rural communities — have a voice on the board.

#### General Characteristics of the Zones

While exact zone boundaries are defined by official maps available from the Lane County Elections Office and the district, the zones generally correspond to recognizable areas of the district:

- **Zone 1** — typically encompasses a portion of central/western Springfield, including areas near downtown and the district administration building
- **Zone 2** — covers a section of Springfield that may include parts of the Gateway area and northern neighborhoods
- **Zone 3** — spans a portion of the district that may include southeastern Springfield and parts of the Goshen area
- **Zone 4** — generally covers the Thurston area and surrounding neighborhoods on the eastern side of the district
- **Zone 5** — often encompasses the most rural portions of the district, including areas toward Mohawk, Walterville, and/or Marcola

*(Note: Zone boundaries are periodically redrawn to reflect population changes. The descriptions above are general characterizations — consult the official zone map from the Lane County Elections Office or the district for current boundaries.)*

The two **at-large** positions (6 and 7) are elected by all registered voters within the district boundaries, regardless of which zone they reside in. At-large members serve the same governance role as zone members — there is no difference in authority, voting power, or committee eligibility.

To be eligible to run for a zone seat, a candidate must reside within that zone. For at-large seats, candidates may reside anywhere within the district boundaries. All candidates must be registered voters in the district.

> **💡 Tip:** If you're considering running for a zone seat, verify your zone assignment with the Lane County Elections Office *before* you file. Zone boundaries do not always align with intuitive neighborhood boundaries, and filing for the wrong zone can disqualify your candidacy.

### Board Positions — Structure and Terms

Because board members' names change with each election cycle, this section focuses on the **structural** aspects of each position — the information that remains constant regardless of who holds the seat.

| Position | Type | Term Cycle | Current Term Expiration (Typical) | Election Year |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Position 1 | Zone 1 | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Odd-year cycle (e.g., 2023, 2027) |
| Position 2 | Zone 2 | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Odd-year cycle |
| Position 3 | Zone 3 | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Even-year cycle (e.g., 2025, 2029) |
| Position 4 | Zone 4 | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Even-year cycle |
| Position 5 | Zone 5 | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Odd-year cycle |
| Position 6 | At-Large | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Even-year cycle |
| Position 7 | At-Large | 4 years | June 30 of expiration year | Odd-year cycle |

Board members take office on July 1 following their election (ORS 332.030). Terms expire on June 30 four years later. Oregon school board elections are held in May of odd-numbered years for positions on the regular election cycle, though the specific positions up in a given year depend on the staggering schedule.

When a **vacancy** occurs mid-term — due to resignation, death, disqualification, or removal — the remaining board members are required to appoint a replacement within a specified timeframe. Under ORS 332.030, if the board fails to fill a vacancy within 90 days, the authority to appoint passes to the Lane County Education Service District (Lane ESD) board. The appointed member serves until the next regular school board election, at which point the seat is filled by voters for the remainder of the original term (if any) or a new full term.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** When a vacancy occurs, some community members expect a "special election" to fill the seat. Oregon law does not require or provide for special elections for school board vacancies — the appointment process is the statutory mechanism. The board should conduct the appointment process transparently and in public session.

---

### Board Officers — Chair and Vice-Chair

The board selects its officers from among its own members. The two primary officer positions are:

- **Board Chair** — presides over all board meetings, works with the superintendent to develop meeting agendas, serves as the board's primary spokesperson, and represents the board in official communications. The chair does not have additional voting power or unilateral authority — the role is facilitative, not executive.
- **Vice-Chair** — serves in the chair's role when the chair is absent or has a conflict of interest. The vice-chair also supports the chair in governance matters and may take on specific liaison or communication responsibilities as agreed upon by the board.

#### Selection Process

Under ORS 332.040, the board must select its chair no later than the **first regular meeting after July 1** of each year — aligning with the start of the fiscal year and the seating of any newly elected members. The selection is made by a vote of the board members. Any member may be nominated (including self-nomination), and the vote is conducted in open session.

The vice-chair is selected through the same process and at the same meeting. There are no term limits on officer positions at the state level — a board member may serve as chair for consecutive years if the board so chooses, although many boards adopt a norm of rotating the position to develop leadership broadly.

> **💡 Tip:** The chair sets the tone for board meetings. If you're considering accepting a nomination for chair, understand that the role requires significant preparation time, close coordination with the superintendent, and the ability to facilitate discussion among members who may disagree. It's a service role, not a power role.

---

### Board Meeting Schedule

Springfield's Board of Directors follows a regular meeting schedule that provides a predictable rhythm for governance:

| Meeting Type | Schedule | Time | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regular Meeting | 2nd Monday of each month | 7:00 PM | Board Room, 640 A Street, Springfield |
| Work Session | 4th Monday of each month | 5:30 PM | Board Room, 640 A Street, Springfield |

All meetings are held at the **Springfield Public Schools Administration Building** at **640 A Street, Springfield, Oregon 97477**, unless otherwise noticed (for example, if a meeting is relocated to a school or community facility for a special purpose).

Both regular meetings and work sessions are **open to the public** under Oregon's Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610–192.690). The distinction between the two types is critical:

#### Regular Meetings
- The board takes **formal action** (votes) at regular meetings
- Agendas include consent items, action items, reports, and public comment
- Minutes are recorded and become part of the permanent public record
- Regular meetings are typically the longer of the two monthly meetings

#### Work Sessions
- Work sessions are designed for **in-depth discussion, presentations, and planning**
- The board generally does **not** take formal votes during work sessions
- Work sessions allow the board to explore complex topics (budget development, policy drafts, strategic planning) without the pressure of immediate decision-making
- These sessions may include presentations from staff, community partners, or consultants
- While no formal votes occur, work sessions are still public meetings subject to notice and open-meeting requirements

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some community members (and even some board members) treat work sessions as less important than regular meetings because no votes are taken. In reality, work sessions are often where the most important substantive discussions occur. By the time an item reaches a regular meeting for a vote, the board has often already formed its thinking during a work session. Missing work sessions means missing the context behind decisions.

The board may also schedule **special meetings** or **executive sessions** as needed. Special meetings require at least 24 hours' public notice with a specific agenda (ORS 192.640(2)). Executive sessions are closed to the public and may only be held for the specific purposes enumerated in ORS 192.660(2), such as personnel matters, real estate negotiations, or consultation with legal counsel regarding litigation.

---

### Board Committees

Springfield's board utilizes **standing committees** and **ad hoc committees** to distribute governance work and allow for deeper engagement on specific topics. Committee structures may evolve over time based on board priorities and workload.

Typical standing committees include:

- **Policy Committee** — reviews and recommends updates to board policies. Oregon school boards maintain comprehensive policy manuals (often based on Oregon School Boards Association templates), and the policy committee ensures these are current, legally compliant, and reflective of the board's intent.
- **Finance / Audit Committee** — provides oversight of the district's financial operations, reviews audit reports, monitors budget-to-actual performance, and advises the full board on fiscal matters.
- **Legislative Committee** — tracks state and federal legislation affecting education, develops the board's legislative priorities, and coordinates advocacy efforts (often through OSBA's legislative process).
- **Superintendent Evaluation Committee** — may be the full board or a subcommittee; responsible for designing and conducting the superintendent's annual performance evaluation.

Committees generally function as advisory bodies — they study issues, discuss options, and bring recommendations to the full board. **Committees do not take binding action** on behalf of the board. All formal decisions are made by the full board in public session.

> **💡 Tip:** Serving on a committee is one of the best ways for a new board member to deepen expertise in a specific area. If offered a committee assignment, accept it — the preparation and discussion will accelerate your learning dramatically.

Committee meetings are subject to Oregon's Public Meetings Law if they involve a quorum of the committee (and, by extension, potentially a quorum of the full board). Notice requirements apply. Board members should be careful about informal gatherings that could inadvertently create an unnoticed committee meeting.

---

### Board Norms and Operating Agreements

Beyond the formal legal requirements, Springfield's board operates under a set of **board norms** or **operating agreements** — voluntary commitments that members make to each other about how they will work together. These norms are typically adopted at the beginning of each board year (after July 1) and may be revisited periodically.

Common norms adopted by school boards in Oregon, including Springfield, may address:

- **Preparation** — members commit to reading board packets thoroughly before meetings
- **Respectful discourse** — disagreements focus on issues, not personalities
- **Unified communication** — after a vote, all members support the decision publicly
- **No surprises** — members share significant concerns with the chair and superintendent before meetings, rather than raising them for the first time at the board table
- **Confidentiality** — information shared in executive session or during sensitive discussions is kept confidential
- **Speaking with one voice** — only the chair (or a designated spokesperson) speaks on behalf of the board; other members speak for themselves only
- **Equity lens** — the board commits to considering the equity implications of every decision

Norms have no legal force — you cannot be removed from office for violating them. But they are the glue that holds a functional board together. Boards that operate without agreed-upon norms, or where members routinely ignore them, tend to become dysfunctional, and dysfunction at the board level inevitably harms students.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some board members treat norms as suggestions rather than commitments. If you agree to a norm — such as "no surprises" — honor it. Springing a controversial topic on the board at a public meeting, without having first discussed it with the chair and superintendent, damages trust and makes productive governance much harder.

---

### Relationship with the Superintendent

The board's relationship with the superintendent is the single most important governance relationship in the district. This topic is covered extensively in Tier 1 and Tier 2 modules, but the Springfield-specific dimensions are worth highlighting.

#### Hiring and Contract
The superintendent is hired by the board through a deliberative process that may include community input, executive search firms, and multiple rounds of interviews. The superintendent serves under a contract approved by the board. Oregon law (ORS 342.513) governs superintendent contracts, including limits on length and provisions for termination.

#### Evaluation Process
The board evaluates the superintendent annually against **mutually agreed-upon goals** that align with the district's strategic plan. A well-structured evaluation process typically includes:

1. **Goal-setting** (early fall) — the board and superintendent agree on 3–5 measurable goals for the year
2. **Mid-year check-in** (January/February) — informal progress review
3. **Formal evaluation** (spring/early summer) — comprehensive review using a structured evaluation instrument
4. **Contract discussion** (as needed) — the board may extend, amend, or decline to renew the superintendent's contract based on the evaluation

The evaluation is the board's most powerful tool for providing direction to the superintendent without crossing into operational management. Clear, measurable goals tied to the strategic plan give the superintendent a mandate to act and give the board a basis for accountability.

#### Communication Protocols
Springfield's board and superintendent typically operate under agreed-upon communication protocols, which may include:

- The superintendent provides regular written updates (often weekly) to all board members
- Individual board members direct questions to the superintendent (not directly to staff)
- The superintendent alerts the board to emerging issues through a "no surprises" protocol
- The board chair serves as the primary board-side point of contact for the superintendent on procedural and scheduling matters
- Media inquiries about board actions are directed to the board chair; inquiries about district operations are directed to the superintendent or communications director

> **💡 Tip:** Establish a communication rhythm with the superintendent early in your tenure. Some superintendents prefer email; others prefer brief phone calls. Ask what works best and respect those preferences. Regular, informal communication prevents misunderstandings from escalating into governance conflicts.

---

### Board Clerk / Secretary Role

Oregon law (ORS 332.040) requires the board to appoint a **clerk** (sometimes called the board secretary). In Springfield, the clerk role is typically filled by a **district staff member** — often the superintendent or a designated administrative assistant — rather than a board member. The clerk's responsibilities include:

- Recording minutes of all board meetings
- Maintaining the official record of board actions
- Posting meeting notices and agendas in compliance with Public Meetings Law
- Ensuring the board's legal and procedural requirements are met
- Managing board correspondence and public records requests related to board business
- Coordinating logistics for board meetings, including room setup, technology, and materials

The clerk is not a voting member of the board and does not participate in governance decisions. The role is administrative but critically important — accurate minutes and proper notice are legal requirements, not optional niceties.

---

### How Board Agendas Are Set

The board meeting agenda is a governance tool. What appears on the agenda determines what the board discusses and acts upon; what doesn't appear on the agenda doesn't get addressed. Understanding how the agenda is built is essential.

In Springfield, the agenda-setting process generally works as follows:

1. **Superintendent drafts the proposed agenda** — based on operational needs, pending policy actions, reports due, and items requested by the board
2. **Board chair reviews and refines** — the chair and superintendent confer (typically a week or more before the meeting) to finalize the agenda
3. **Board members may request items** — individual members can request that items be added to a future agenda by communicating with the chair. However, the chair has discretion to determine scheduling and placement; a single member cannot unilaterally place items on the agenda
4. **Board packet is distributed** — the complete agenda with supporting documents (the "board packet") is distributed to members in advance — typically 4–7 days before the meeting
5. **Agenda is posted publicly** — in compliance with Public Meetings Law, the agenda is posted on the district website and at the district office

> **💡 Tip:** Read the board packet thoroughly *before* the meeting. If you have questions about a specific item, contact the superintendent in advance so they can prepare an answer. This practice respects the board's time, avoids surprises, and results in more productive meetings.

A typical regular meeting agenda includes:

- **Call to order and roll call**
- **Adoption of the agenda** (the board formally approves the agenda at the start of each meeting)
- **Public comment / audience participation**
- **Consent agenda** — routine items (approval of minutes, personnel actions, contracts under a certain threshold) grouped for a single vote
- **Action items** — items requiring board discussion and a formal vote
- **Reports and presentations** — updates from the superintendent, staff, or community partners
- **Board member reports** — individual members share information about committee work, community events attended, or upcoming items
- **Adjournment**

---

### Public Participation

Community engagement is a cornerstone of democratic governance. Springfield's board provides several avenues for public participation:

- **Public comment at regular meetings** — most regular meeting agendas include a designated time for community members to address the board. Speakers typically sign up in advance and are allotted a limited time (usually 3–5 minutes). The board listens but generally does not respond during the meeting; follow-up is handled through the superintendent.
- **Written comments** — community members may submit written comments to the board via email or mail. These are typically shared with all board members and may be included in the public record.
- **Budget committee meetings** — Oregon law (ORS 294.414) requires that the budget committee (half board members, half community appointees) hold public hearings during the budget development process. These are key opportunities for community input on spending priorities.
- **Town halls and community forums** — the board or superintendent may periodically hold public forums on specific topics (bond measures, strategic planning, school closures).
- **OSBA community engagement resources** — the Oregon School Boards Association provides tools and frameworks for structured community engagement.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some board members take public comment personally, especially when the comments are critical. Remember that public comment is a legal right under Oregon's Public Meetings Law, and community members are speaking to the *board as a body*, not to you individually. Do not argue with speakers, interrupt them, or respond defensively. Listen, take notes, and follow up through appropriate channels.

### Board Calendar — The Annual Governance Cycle

Board governance follows a predictable annual cycle. While specific dates vary, the general rhythm in Springfield looks like this:

| Period | Key Activities |
|---|---|
| **July** | New board members seated (July 1); election of board chair and vice-chair; board norms adoption; committee assignments |
| **August–September** | Board retreat / goal-setting; superintendent goal-setting for the year; start of school logistics |
| **October–November** | First-quarter financial review; OSBA Annual Convention (typically November); legislative priorities development |
| **December–January** | Mid-year superintendent check-in; enrollment projections for next year; beginning of budget development |
| **February–March** | Budget development intensifies; superintendent evaluation begins; collective bargaining preparation (if contracts expiring) |
| **April–May** | Budget committee meetings and public hearings; adoption of the budget; board elections (May of odd-numbered years); superintendent evaluation completed |
| **June** | Budget finalized and appropriated; year-end reports; outgoing member recognition; transition planning for new members |

> **💡 Tip:** At the start of your term, ask the superintendent or board chair for the board's full annual calendar — including standing committee meeting dates, OSBA events, legislative deadlines, and key operational milestones. Block these dates on your personal calendar immediately. Board service is a significant time commitment, and proactive scheduling prevents conflicts.

### Springfield Board Culture and History

Every board has a culture — the unwritten norms, expectations, and patterns of behavior that define how members interact with each other, with the superintendent, and with the community. Springfield's board culture has been shaped by decades of experience, including:

- **Leadership transitions** — the district has seen multiple superintendents over the past two decades, and each transition has influenced board-superintendent dynamics
- **Community engagement on bonds and levies** — the district's history of seeking voter approval for facilities bonds has required the board to develop strong community communication skills
- **Navigating economic challenges** — Springfield's working-class economic base means the board has frequently faced difficult budget decisions, including staffing reductions during economic downturns
- **Balancing urban and rural needs** — the district's geographic diversity creates tensions around resource allocation (e.g., maintaining small rural schools versus consolidating for efficiency)
- **Relationship with the Springfield Education Association (SEA)** — labor relations have at times been collaborative and at times contentious, reflecting broader tensions in Oregon education funding

Understanding this history helps new board members interpret the culture they are entering. A board that has recently been through a contentious superintendent search, a difficult bargaining cycle, or a failed bond measure will have a different dynamic than one that is in a period of stability.

> **💡 Tip:** Early in your tenure, have one-on-one conversations with each of your fellow board members. Ask them about the board's recent history, what they see as the board's strengths and challenges, and what they wish they'd known when they started. These conversations build relationships and provide context that you won't find in any document.

---

### Board Governance Documents

Springfield's board operates under several layers of governance documents:

- **Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS Chapter 332)** — the primary state law governing school boards, establishing board authority, elections, vacancies, meetings, and powers
- **Board Policies** — a comprehensive manual of policies adopted by the board, typically organized using the OSBA coding system (e.g., "BB" for board organization, "GC" for licensed staff, "JF" for student rights). These policies are available on the district website and on the OSBA policy reference platform.
- **Administrative Regulations** — developed by the superintendent to implement board policies. These are operational documents; the board does not typically vote on administrative regulations.
- **Board Operating Agreements / Norms** — the voluntary commitments described earlier in this module
- **Superintendent Contract** — the employment agreement between the board and the superintendent
- **Collective Bargaining Agreements** — contracts with the SEA and other bargaining units
- **Strategic Plan** — the board's multi-year framework for district direction and priorities
- **Annual Budget** — the adopted budget, including the general fund and all special funds

All of these documents are public records, available upon request under Oregon's Public Records Law (ORS 192.311–192.478). Board policies and meeting agendas/minutes are typically posted on the district website for easy access.

---

### How to Access Board Meeting Recordings, Agendas, and Minutes

Springfield SD 19 makes governance information accessible to the public through several channels:

- **District website** (springfield.k12.or.us) — the primary source for board meeting agendas, minutes, board packets, and policy documents. Agendas are typically posted several days before each meeting.
- **Meeting recordings** — the district may provide video or audio recordings of board meetings via the district website, YouTube channel, or a third-party platform. Availability may vary.
- **Board packet** — the comprehensive set of documents prepared for each meeting, including background information, staff recommendations, financial reports, and proposed policy language. Board packets are public records and are typically posted alongside the agenda.
- **Minutes** — official minutes of board meetings are approved by the board at a subsequent meeting and posted on the district website. Minutes are the legal record of board actions.
- **Public records requests** — any community member may submit a public records request under ORS 192.311–192.478 for board-related documents. The district typically has a designated public records officer who processes these requests.

> **💡 Tip:** Set up a recurring reminder to check the district website for the board packet as soon as it is posted each month. Reading the full packet before the meeting is the single most important preparation habit for effective board service.

### Comparison: Springfield's Governance Structure vs. Other Oregon Districts

Springfield's seven-member, zone-based board structure is one of several models used by Oregon school districts. Understanding how Springfield's structure compares to other districts provides useful context:

| Feature | Springfield SD 19 | Eugene 4J | Bethel SD 52 | Salem-Keizer SD 24J |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Board size | 7 members | 7 members | 7 members | 7 members |
| Election method | 5 zone + 2 at-large | 7 zones | 7 zones | 7 zones |
| Term length | 4 years | 4 years | 4 years | 4 years |
| Meeting frequency | 2x/month (regular + work session) | 2x/month | 2x/month | 2x/month |
| Superintendent relationship | Board's sole employee | Board's sole employee | Board's sole employee | Board's sole employee |

Springfield's hybrid model (zone + at-large) is distinctive. The at-large positions ensure that some members represent the entire district rather than a specific geographic area, which can provide a counterbalance to zone-specific interests. This is especially relevant in a district with significant geographic diversity — at-large members may be more inclined to consider district-wide implications of decisions, while zone members bring localized knowledge and constituency relationships.

Most Oregon districts of comparable or larger size use a seven-member board. Smaller districts may operate with five members. The Oregon legislature has set the minimum board size at five members (ORS 332.005), though districts may adopt a larger board through resolution or charter.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Board members from other civic or nonprofit boards sometimes expect Robert's Rules of Order to govern every aspect of board meetings. While many Oregon school boards use Robert's Rules as a parliamentary guide, ORS Chapter 332 and Oregon's Public Meetings Law take precedence. Familiarize yourself with the board's adopted parliamentary procedures — they may be a simplified version of Robert's Rules or a locally developed set of procedural guidelines.
