## Overview

The Springfield School District 19 Board of Directors is the elected governing body responsible for setting policy, approving budgets, and providing oversight of the district's educational mission. The board is composed of five members, each representing a geographic zone within the district's boundaries. Board members are elected by voters within their respective zones and serve four-year terms, with elections staggered so that not all seats are up for vote in the same cycle.

As of February 2026, the board is operating with a vacancy in Position 2. The remaining members are continuing to fulfill their governance responsibilities while conducting a statutory appointment process to fill the open seat. Among the current members is Ken, who was elected in 2023 and brings a background as an Oregon State University graduate and retired Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) engineer. Each member contributes unique professional and community experience to the board's collective decision-making.

The board conducts its business through a regular meeting schedule held at the Board Room, located at 640 A Street, Springfield, Oregon 97477. Regular meetings take place on the second Monday of each month at 7:00 PM, and Work Sessions are held on the fourth Monday at 5:30 PM. Both types of meetings are open to the public in accordance with Oregon's public meetings law. The distinction between regular meetings and work sessions is important: regular meetings are where the board takes formal action (votes), while work sessions are typically reserved for in-depth discussion, presentations, and planning without formal votes.

Leadership within the board is organized around the role of the board chair, who presides over meetings, sets agendas in consultation with the superintendent, and serves as the board's primary spokesperson. The board selects its chair from among its own members no later than the first regular meeting after July 1 of each year, aligning with the start of the fiscal year.

## Key Concepts

### Five-Member Board Structure

Springfield SD 19 operates with a five-member board of directors. Each member is elected from a geographic zone within the district, ensuring that all parts of the community — urban, suburban, and rural — have representation. This zoned structure means that board members are accountable to the voters in their specific area while also bearing responsibility for district-wide decisions. Staggered four-year terms provide continuity, ensuring that experienced members remain on the board even as new members join.

### The Position 2 Vacancy

As of February 2026, Position 2 on the board is vacant. When a vacancy occurs, Oregon law (ORS 332) requires the remaining board members to appoint a replacement within a defined timeframe. The district has opened a public application process to identify candidates, and the board is conducting interviews and deliberations in public session. This situation is a real-time example of board governance in action — a topic covered in greater depth in module T3-M04.

### Meeting Schedule and Public Access

The board's regular meeting schedule — second Monday at 7:00 PM for regular meetings, fourth Monday at 5:30 PM for work sessions — provides a predictable rhythm for governance. All meetings are held in the Board Room at the district office and are open to the public. Regular meetings include opportunities for public comment, and agendas and minutes are posted on the district website in advance. Understanding this schedule is essential for new board members, as consistent attendance and preparation are among the most basic expectations of board service.

### Role of the Board Chair

The board chair is not a position of unilateral authority but rather a facilitative leadership role. The chair presides over meetings, ensures orderly discussion, and works with the superintendent to develop meeting agendas. The chair also serves as the primary point of contact between the board and the superintendent on procedural matters. The board selects its chair annually — no later than the first regular meeting after July 1 — through a vote of its members. Any member may be nominated, and the selection process itself is an act of collective governance.
