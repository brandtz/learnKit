## Overview

Education Service Districts (ESDs) are one of the most important — and most misunderstood — features of Oregon's public education system. As a Springfield Public Schools board member, your district exists within a web of regional relationships, and the most significant of those is with **Lane Education Service District (Lane ESD)**. Understanding how Lane ESD operates, what services it provides, and how Springfield interacts with it as a component district will make you a more effective board member and a better steward of your community's educational resources.

This module provides a comprehensive look at ESDs under Oregon law, Lane ESD's specific structure and services, the funding mechanisms that support regional service delivery, and the practical dynamics of the Springfield–Lane ESD relationship. You'll learn which services Springfield uses, which it provides independently, and how you as a board member can engage productively with ESD governance.

## Education Service Districts Under Oregon Law

### Statutory Foundation — ORS Chapter 334

Education Service Districts were created by the Oregon Legislature and are governed primarily by **ORS Chapter 334**. The ESD system replaced the former "intermediate education districts" (IEDs) in the 1960s and 1970s, reflecting a recognition that many educational services could be delivered more efficiently and effectively at a regional level than by individual districts — especially Oregon's many small, rural districts.

Key statutory provisions:

- **ORS 334.005** — Defines ESDs as regional education agencies
- **ORS 334.010** — Establishes the boundaries of ESDs, which generally align with county boundaries (though some ESDs cover multiple counties)
- **ORS 334.125** — Establishes that ESDs are governed by elected boards, providing democratic accountability at the regional level
- **ORS 334.175** — Authorizes ESDs to provide a wide range of educational and administrative services to component districts
- **ORS 334.185** — Requires ESDs to develop Local Service Plans in collaboration with component districts

### Purpose of ESDs

The fundamental purpose of ESDs is to provide services that would be inefficient, impractical, or impossible for individual districts to provide on their own. Oregon's education landscape includes more than 190 school districts, many of which are very small. ESDs achieve **economies of scale** by pooling resources across districts.

ESDs serve three core functions under Oregon law:

1. **Service delivery** — Providing direct educational and administrative services to component districts (special education, technology, professional development, business services)
2. **Regional coordination** — Facilitating collaboration among districts on shared challenges and opportunities
3. **Capacity building** — Helping smaller districts access expertise and resources they could not afford independently

### ESD Governance Structure

Each ESD is governed by an **elected board of directors** (ORS 334.125). ESD board members are elected from geographic zones within the ESD boundaries. The ESD board:

- Hires and evaluates the ESD superintendent
- Adopts the annual budget
- Approves the Local Service Plan
- Sets policy for ESD operations
- Represents the interests of all component districts

> 💡 **Tip**: ESD board elections often receive very little public attention, but ESD board decisions directly affect the services your district receives. Pay attention to who is running for Lane ESD board seats in your zone, and encourage informed community members to consider running.

## Lane ESD — Structure and Service Area

### Geographic Scope

Lane ESD serves **16 component school districts** across Lane County, one of the largest counties in Oregon by land area. These districts range dramatically in size:

| District | Approximate Enrollment | Relative Size |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| Eugene 4J | ~16,000 | Large |
| **Springfield** | **~10,000** | **Large** |
| Bethel | ~5,500 | Medium |
| South Lane (Cottage Grove) | ~2,500 | Medium |
| Creswell | ~1,400 | Small |
| Pleasant Hill | ~700 | Small |
| Junction City | ~1,800 | Small-Medium |
| Mapleton | ~150 | Very Small |
| McKenzie | ~100 | Very Small |
| Crow-Applegate-Lorane | ~250 | Very Small |
| Fern Ridge (Elmira) | ~1,500 | Small |
| Lowell | ~300 | Very Small |
| Marcola | ~250 | Very Small |
| Oakridge | ~500 | Very Small |
| Siuslaw (Florence) | ~1,200 | Small |
| Blachly | ~60 | Very Small |

This enrollment disparity is crucial context. For very small districts like Mapleton, McKenzie, Blachly, and Marcola, Lane ESD is an absolute lifeline — providing services these districts could never afford independently. For larger districts like Springfield, the relationship is more selective: Springfield uses certain ESD services and provides others independently.

### Lane ESD Governance

Lane ESD is governed by a **seven-member elected board** representing geographic zones within Lane County. The board:

- Meets regularly (typically monthly) at the Lane ESD offices in Eugene
- Appoints and evaluates the Lane ESD Superintendent
- Adopts the annual budget and Local Service Plan
- Board meetings are open to the public under the same ORS 192 public meeting requirements that apply to Springfield's board

The **Lane ESD Superintendent** serves as the chief executive officer, responsible for day-to-day operations, personnel, and implementation of the Local Service Plan.

> 💡 **Tip**: Lane ESD board meeting agendas and minutes are public documents. Make it a habit to review them periodically — especially when issues affecting Springfield are on the agenda. You can usually find them on Lane ESD's website.

## Lane ESD Services — Comprehensive Overview

### Special Education (SPED)

Special education is typically the **largest single service** provided by ESDs across Oregon, and Lane ESD is no exception. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Oregon's special education statutes (ORS Chapter 343), every student with a disability is entitled to a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE).

#### How Lane ESD Provides SPED Services

For many of its smaller component districts, Lane ESD serves as the **primary special education service provider**. This means Lane ESD:

- Employs special education teachers, specialists, and paraprofessionals who work in component district schools
- Conducts evaluations and assessments for students referred for special education
- Develops and helps implement Individualized Education Programs (IEPs)
- Provides related services such as speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and school psychology
- Manages compliance with federal and state reporting requirements
- Provides specialized programs for students with significant needs (autism, emotional disturbance, intellectual disability, sensory impairments)

#### Regional Programs

Lane ESD operates several **regional special education programs** that serve students from multiple districts:

- Programs for students with significant cognitive disabilities
- Programs for students with autism spectrum disorder who need intensive support
- Programs for students who are deaf or hard of hearing
- Programs for students with visual impairments
- Transition programs for students aged 18–21

These regional programs exist because no single district (even Eugene or Springfield) has enough students with certain low-incidence disabilities to justify a standalone program. By pooling students from across the region, Lane ESD can provide specialized instruction and services that individual districts could not.

#### Springfield's Unique Position on SPED

**This is a critically important distinction**: Unlike many smaller component districts, **Springfield Public Schools largely provides its own special education services.** Springfield employs its own special education teachers, specialists, and paraprofessionals. Springfield manages its own IEP processes and compliance systems.

However, Springfield does use certain Lane ESD SPED resources:

- **Low-incidence disability specialists** — for students with rare conditions where Springfield may not have in-house expertise
- **Regional programs** — when a Springfield student's needs are best met in a regional program
- **Professional development** — Lane ESD provides training on special education best practices, legal updates, and evidence-based interventions
- **Technical assistance** — compliance support, data analysis, and consultation

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: New board members sometimes assume that Lane ESD "runs" special education for Springfield. This is incorrect. Springfield is largely self-sufficient in SPED, which distinguishes it from smaller districts where Lane ESD is the primary SPED provider. Understanding this distinction is important when discussing ESD funding and services.

### Technology Infrastructure

Lane ESD provides critical technology infrastructure services that benefit all component districts, including Springfield. This is one of the areas where the ESD model delivers the clearest economies of scale.

#### Network and Internet Services

- **Wide Area Network (WAN)** — Lane ESD operates the regional network that connects school buildings across the county
- **Internet connectivity** — Lane ESD aggregates internet bandwidth purchases for component districts, achieving significantly lower per-megabit costs through bulk purchasing
- **Oregon Education Technology Consortium (OETC)** — Lane ESD participates in statewide purchasing cooperatives that further reduce technology costs
- **E-Rate** — Lane ESD helps component districts navigate the federal E-Rate program, which provides substantial discounts (typically 60–80%) on eligible telecommunications and internet services for schools. The E-Rate application process is complex, and Lane ESD's expertise saves individual districts significant staff time

#### Student Information Systems and Data

- Lane ESD supports the regional implementation of student information systems
- Data reporting to the Oregon Department of Education
- Student data privacy compliance (FERPA, Oregon Student Records Law)
- Data dashboards and analytics tools

#### Cybersecurity

- Network security monitoring and threat detection
- Email filtering and phishing protection
- Incident response support
- Security policy consulting
- Staff cybersecurity awareness training

> 💡 **Tip**: Technology costs represent one of the clearest value propositions for ESD membership. Springfield benefits from Lane ESD's bulk purchasing power and technical expertise in areas like E-Rate and cybersecurity, even though Springfield has its own IT department. When evaluating ESD services, technology is often where the return on investment is most easily quantified.

### Professional Development

Lane ESD serves as a regional hub for educator professional development:

- **Instructional coaching** — specialists who work with teachers in component districts on instructional improvement
- **New teacher support** — mentoring programs for beginning educators
- **Curriculum alignment** — helping districts align curriculum with Oregon state standards
- **Assessment literacy** — training on state assessment systems and data-driven instruction
- **Culturally responsive teaching** — professional development on equity, inclusion, and meeting the needs of diverse learners
- **Leadership development** — programs for aspiring and current administrators

Springfield typically sends staff to Lane ESD professional development offerings when the topic aligns with district priorities, and sometimes contracts with Lane ESD for customized training.

### Student Services

Beyond special education, Lane ESD provides several student-focused services:

- **Alternative education programs** — for students who need non-traditional educational settings
- **Outdoor school** — Lane ESD coordinates outdoor education programs, though availability and format vary
- **Regional STEM initiatives** — STEM hub coordination, connecting schools with industry partners
- **Talented and Gifted (TAG) support** — consultation and program development for component districts
- **Threat assessment consultation** — supporting districts in evaluating and responding to safety concerns
- **Homeless and foster youth services** — coordination and compliance support under the McKinney-Vento Act

### Business and Administrative Services

For smaller districts that cannot afford full-time business managers or HR specialists, Lane ESD provides:

- **Payroll processing** — managing payroll for small district employees
- **Financial accounting** — maintaining financial records and preparing reports
- **Human resources** — support with recruitment, hiring, and employee relations
- **Insurance pooling** — participating in regional insurance cooperatives for property, liability, and workers' compensation coverage
- **Procurement** — cooperative purchasing programs for supplies, equipment, and services

Springfield, as a larger district, generally handles these functions in-house with its own business office and HR department. However, Springfield may participate in **cooperative purchasing agreements** facilitated by Lane ESD, where bulk buying across districts yields better pricing.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members sometimes view ESD services as an "all-or-nothing" proposition — either the district uses all services or none. In reality, the relationship is modular. Springfield selectively uses the services that provide value while maintaining independence in areas where it has sufficient internal capacity.

## ESD Funding — How the Money Works

### State ESD Funding Formula

ESD funding in Oregon comes primarily from the **State School Fund** through a dedicated ESD funding formula, separate from the formula that funds individual school districts. Key elements:

- **ORS 327.019** establishes the ESD funding formula
- ESDs receive funding based on the **aggregate enrollment** of their component districts
- The formula provides a **per-student amount** that is multiplied by total component district enrollment
- ESDs may also receive grants, federal funds, and fees for services from component districts
- ESDs **do not have independent taxing authority** — they cannot levy property taxes. This is a fundamental difference from school districts

#### How Funding Flows

```
State Legislature → State School Fund → ESD Formula → Lane ESD → Services to Component Districts
```

The ESD funding formula is separate from the per-student funding that goes to individual school districts. In other words, the money Lane ESD receives does not "come out of" Springfield's budget — it is a separate allocation from the state.

However, there is an indirect connection: the total State School Fund is finite, and the legislature decides how much of it goes to the ESD formula versus the school district formula. Board members should be aware that ESD funding levels are a perennial topic in legislative sessions.

> 💡 **Tip**: Understanding ESD funding is important during legislative sessions. When the legislature considers changes to the ESD formula, it can directly affect the services Lane ESD is able to provide. Springfield's board should monitor legislative developments through OSBA's legislative updates and communicate with legislators about the value of ESD services.

### Component District Contributions and Fees

In addition to formula funding, some ESD services are provided on a **fee-for-service** basis. Component districts may:

- Contract with the ESD for specific services beyond what formula funding covers
- Participate in cooperative programs where costs are shared
- Pay fees for optional technology services, professional development, or specialized programs

This means that some Lane ESD services are "included" in the base formula funding, while others cost additional money. Springfield's administration evaluates these optional services annually to determine which provide good value.

---

## The Local Service Plan

### What It Is

The **Local Service Plan (LSP)** is the foundational planning document for every ESD in Oregon. Required by **ORS 334.185**, the LSP:

- Defines the services the ESD will provide to component districts
- Establishes priorities and goals for the planning period (typically 3–4 years)
- Reflects input from component districts about their needs
- Serves as a kind of "contract" between the ESD and its component districts — defining what services will be delivered and how

### How It's Developed

The LSP development process is collaborative by law:

1. **Needs assessment** — Lane ESD surveys component districts about their service needs and priorities
2. **Superintendent input** — Component district superintendents participate in advisory committees and planning sessions
3. **Draft development** — Lane ESD administration drafts the plan based on input and available funding
4. **Component district review** — Each component district's board has an opportunity to review and provide feedback
5. **Adoption** — The Lane ESD board adopts the final LSP
6. **Oregon Department of Education review** — ODE reviews the LSP for compliance with state requirements

### Current Plan Highlights

While specific priorities shift over time, Lane ESD's Local Service Plans have consistently emphasized:

- **Equitable access to quality education** across all 16 component districts, regardless of size
- **Special education** as the largest service area
- **Technology infrastructure** as a critical shared resource
- **Educator professional development** focused on state priorities (literacy, math, equity)
- **Student mental health and well-being** — an increasing priority in recent planning cycles
- **Post-secondary readiness** — college and career preparation programs and supports

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members sometimes view the Local Service Plan as a document that "happens to them" rather than one they can influence. As a Springfield board member, you can — and should — advocate for services that meet Springfield's needs during the LSP development process. Your superintendent participates in planning, but the board's voice matters too.

> 💡 **Tip**: When the Local Service Plan comes up for renewal (typically every 3–4 years), ask your superintendent to present a summary of the draft plan to the Springfield board. Discuss which services are most valuable, which might be added, and whether the plan reflects Springfield's priorities. Your feedback goes back to Lane ESD through the superintendent advisory process.

## Springfield's Relationship with Lane ESD

### Which Services Springfield Uses

As one of the two largest districts in Lane County, Springfield has significant internal capacity. The Springfield–Lane ESD relationship is best understood through a **service-by-service analysis**:

| Service Area | Springfield Uses Lane ESD? | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Special education (core) | Partially | Springfield runs its own SPED program but uses regional programs and specialists for low-incidence disabilities |
| Speech-language pathology | Mostly independent | Springfield employs its own SLPs |
| School psychology | Mostly independent | Springfield employs its own school psychologists |
| Occupational/Physical therapy | Mixed | Some services through Lane ESD |
| Technology — WAN/Internet | **Yes** | Significant cost savings through regional network |
| Technology — E-Rate | **Yes** | Lane ESD manages the complex application process |
| Technology — Cybersecurity | **Yes** | Shared monitoring and incident response |
| Professional development | **Selectively** | Springfield sends staff to relevant Lane ESD offerings |
| Alternative education | **Selectively** | Some students attend regional alternative programs |
| Business services (payroll, accounting) | **No** | Springfield has its own business office |
| Human resources | **No** | Springfield has its own HR department |
| Cooperative purchasing | **Yes** | Bulk purchasing of supplies and technology equipment |
| Student data/reporting | **Partially** | Some shared systems and compliance support |
| Outdoor school | **Yes** | Regional program |
| STEM/Regional programs | **Yes** | Participation in regional initiatives |

### What Springfield Provides Independently

Springfield's size (approximately 10,000 students, 20+ schools) gives it the critical mass to independently provide many services that smaller districts rely on Lane ESD for:

- **Curriculum and instruction department** — with content specialists in major subject areas
- **Special education department** — with its own administrators, teachers, specialists, and paraprofessionals
- **Business and finance office** — full-service budget, accounting, and payroll
- **Human resources department** — recruitment, hiring, employee relations, and labor relations
- **Information technology department** — network management, device deployment, help desk (though Springfield still benefits from Lane ESD's regional network)
- **Communications and public relations**
- **Facilities and maintenance**

> 💡 **Tip**: Springfield's independence in these areas doesn't mean Lane ESD has no value for the district. The value proposition shifts from "we can't do this without them" to "they help us do this more efficiently and at lower cost." Technology infrastructure and specialized SPED services are typically where Springfield derives the greatest direct benefit from the ESD relationship.

### How Springfield's Board Interacts with Lane ESD

The component district relationship between Springfield and Lane ESD operates at several levels:

#### Superintendent Level
- Springfield's superintendent participates in the **Lane ESD Superintendent Advisory Committee**, which provides input on ESD priorities, services, and the Local Service Plan
- Regular communication between Springfield's superintendent and Lane ESD's superintendent on matters of mutual interest

#### Staff Level
- Springfield staff work directly with Lane ESD staff on technology services, professional development, special education consultations, and regional programs
- Lane ESD specialists may visit Springfield schools to provide support

#### Board Level
- Springfield board members may attend Lane ESD board meetings as observers
- Lane ESD board members may attend Springfield board meetings
- When significant policy changes or budget decisions are under consideration at Lane ESD, Springfield's board should be aware and may wish to provide formal input
- OSBA facilitates communication between school boards and ESD boards through regional networks

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Some component district board members never attend an ESD board meeting or pay attention to ESD governance. Given that Lane ESD receives state funding based on Springfield's enrollment (among others) and provides services to Springfield students, ignoring ESD governance means ignoring part of the system that serves your community.

---

## Regional Programs and Initiatives

### Alternative Education

Lane ESD operates or coordinates regional alternative education programs for students who are not thriving in traditional school settings. Under **ORS 336.615–336.665**, districts must provide alternative education options. Lane ESD programs may include:

- Alternative schools with modified schedules and teaching approaches
- Online and blended learning options
- Programs focused on credit recovery and graduation completion
- Partnerships with community colleges for dual enrollment

### Regional STEM Hub

Lane ESD participates in Oregon's **STEM Hub** network, connecting schools with:

- Local industry partners (technology companies, healthcare, manufacturing)
- STEM career exploration programs
- Professional development for STEM teachers
- Grant funding for STEM equipment and curriculum
- Competitions, fairs, and showcase events

### Regional Promise Programs

- College and career readiness programs
- Scholarship and financial aid awareness
- Partnerships with Lane Community College and the University of Oregon
- Data sharing and tracking of student outcomes after high school

### Outdoor Education

Outdoor school has a long tradition in Oregon, and Lane ESD coordinates regional outdoor education programs. Following the passage of **Measure 99 (2016)**, which directed state funding to support outdoor school for all fifth and sixth graders, Lane ESD has played a role in ensuring component district students have access to these experiences.

---

## Recent Lane ESD Strategic Priorities

While specific strategic plans evolve, Lane ESD's recent priorities have included:

1. **Equity and access** — Ensuring that students in the smallest and most rural districts receive educational opportunities comparable to those in Eugene and Springfield
2. **Mental health and well-being** — Expanding access to school counselors, mental health specialists, and social-emotional learning programs, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic
3. **Educator workforce** — Addressing the statewide teacher shortage through recruitment programs, grow-your-own initiatives, and retention support
4. **Literacy improvement** — Supporting component districts in implementing evidence-based reading instruction aligned with Oregon's Early Literacy Framework
5. **Technology modernization** — Upgrading regional network infrastructure, expanding cybersecurity capabilities, and supporting districts in leveraging technology for instruction
6. **Wildfire recovery** — Following the devastating 2020 wildfires that affected several Lane County communities (including the McKenzie School District), Lane ESD has been involved in recovery and rebuilding efforts

> 💡 **Tip**: Lane ESD's strategic priorities should align with the needs of component districts. If you feel Springfield's priorities are not reflected in Lane ESD's direction, raise the issue with your superintendent, who can advocate through the advisory process. Board-to-board communication is also appropriate.

## How a Board Member Should Engage with ESD Issues

### Stay Informed

- Read Lane ESD board meeting agendas and minutes periodically
- Ask your superintendent for updates on ESD services and any changes that affect Springfield
- Review the Local Service Plan when it comes up for renewal
- Attend at least one Lane ESD board meeting per year as an observer

### Advocate for Springfield's Interests

- Ensure Springfield's priorities are reflected in the Local Service Plan
- Support your superintendent in advocating for services that benefit Springfield students
- When legislative issues affecting ESD funding arise, understand how they would impact Lane ESD and Springfield

### Understand the Budget

- Know how much Lane ESD receives in state formula funding based on Springfield's enrollment
- Understand which services Springfield pays for beyond formula funding
- Evaluate whether fee-for-service offerings provide good value compared to alternatives

### Build Relationships

- Get to know Lane ESD board members — especially those representing zones that include Springfield
- Attend OSBA events where ESD and component district board members interact
- Support collaboration rather than competition between districts in the region

### Ask the Right Questions

When ESD issues come before your board, consider asking:

- What services does Lane ESD provide that Springfield could not provide more cost-effectively on its own?
- What services does Lane ESD provide that Springfield could not provide at all without regional collaboration?
- Are there services Springfield should be requesting from Lane ESD that it currently isn't using?
- How does Springfield's enrollment affect Lane ESD's formula funding, and are we receiving proportionate value?
- What is the quality of Lane ESD's services, and how do we measure that?

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members sometimes take an adversarial stance toward the ESD, viewing it as a competitor or an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. While healthy skepticism is appropriate, ESDs are legally mandated partners in Oregon's education system. The most productive approach is constructive engagement — advocating for value while supporting the regional collaboration that benefits all students.

## ESD Services vs. District Services — A Framework for Analysis

When evaluating any particular service, consider this decision framework:

| Factor | Favors ESD Delivery | Favors District Delivery |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Scale** | Service benefits from pooling across districts | Service is district-specific and doesn't scale regionally |
| **Expertise** | Specialized expertise that a single district can't justify employing full-time | District has sufficient in-house expertise |
| **Cost** | Regional purchasing/delivery is more cost-effective | District can deliver more cheaply on its own |
| **Customization** | Standardized delivery is acceptable | District needs highly customized approach |
| **Responsiveness** | Regional timeline is acceptable | District needs immediate, on-demand response |
| **Enrollment** | Smaller district with limited resources | Larger district with internal capacity |
| **Compliance** | Complex regulatory requirements benefit from shared expertise | District has staff dedicated to compliance |

For Springfield, this framework generally yields:

- **Use Lane ESD for**: Technology infrastructure, bulk purchasing, regional special education programs, outdoor school, STEM/regional initiatives, E-Rate management
- **Provide independently**: Core special education, HR, finance, curriculum and instruction, facilities
- **Evaluate annually**: Professional development, student services, data/reporting support

---

## Summary

Lane Education Service District is a vital part of Oregon's public education infrastructure, and Springfield's relationship with Lane ESD represents a strategic partnership that should be actively managed by the board.

**Key takeaways:**

- ESDs are created by Oregon law (ORS 334) to provide regional services that achieve economies of scale and ensure equity across districts of all sizes
- Lane ESD serves 16 component districts with enormous variation in size — from Blachly's 60 students to Eugene's 16,000
- Lane ESD's core services include special education, technology, professional development, student services, and business administration
- Springfield, as a large district, selectively uses Lane ESD services — primarily technology infrastructure, regional SPED programs, cooperative purchasing, and specialized support
- ESD funding comes through a separate state formula, not directly from Springfield's budget — but total State School Fund appropriation affects both
- The Local Service Plan is the key planning document, and Springfield should actively participate in its development
- Board members should stay informed about ESD governance, advocate for Springfield's interests, and build productive relationships with Lane ESD leadership
- The most effective approach is constructive engagement — recognizing that Lane ESD is both a legally mandated partner and a genuinely valuable resource for regional education
