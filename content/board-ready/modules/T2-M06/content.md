## Overview

Education Service Districts (ESDs) are a distinctive feature of Oregon's public education system, designed to provide regional support and specialized services to local school districts that would be difficult or inefficient for individual districts to provide on their own. Lane Education Service District (Lane ESD) is the regional ESD serving all 16 school districts in Lane County, including Springfield School District 19. Understanding the role of Lane ESD — and the relationship between the ESD and the local board — is important for any Springfield board member.

Lane ESD is not a supervisory body. It does not have authority over local board decisions, nor does it set policy for the districts it serves. Instead, it functions as a service agency, offering a menu of specialized programs and supports that districts can access based on their needs and priorities. The ESD's core service areas include special education, technology infrastructure and support, school improvement and professional development, and administrative services. The specific services that Springfield receives from Lane ESD are defined through a formal agreement called the Local Service Plan, which the Springfield board reviews and approves on a regular cycle.

Lane ESD is led by Superintendent Tony Scurto and serves a diverse range of districts across Lane County — from the large urban districts of Eugene 4J and Springfield SD 19 to small rural districts with only a few hundred students. This regional model allows the ESD to achieve economies of scale, provide access to specialized staff (such as speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, and technology specialists), and coordinate services that benefit students across the county. For Springfield board members, Lane ESD is both a key partner and a significant line item in the district's service agreements, making it important to understand how the relationship works and how the board exercises oversight.

## Key Concepts

### What an ESD Is and How It's Funded

Education Service Districts are regional entities established under Oregon law to provide services to local school districts that benefit from shared resources and regional coordination. ESDs are funded through a combination of state funding (a portion of the State School Fund is allocated to ESDs), federal grants, and contracts with local districts for specific services. The funding model is designed to ensure that all districts — regardless of size — have access to high-quality specialized services. The ESD does not levy its own property taxes; instead, its funding flows primarily through the state formula and through service agreements with the districts it serves. Board members should understand that the district's payments to Lane ESD represent a significant investment, and the board has a role in evaluating whether the services received justify the cost.

### Lane ESD's Four Service Areas

Lane ESD organizes its work into four primary service areas. First, special education services are among the most significant offerings, including staffing support, compliance assistance, and direct services for students with disabilities. Second, technology services encompass network infrastructure, device management, cybersecurity support, and data systems that districts rely on for daily operations. Third, school improvement services provide professional development, instructional coaching, curriculum support, and grant coordination to help districts improve academic outcomes. Fourth, administrative services include business support, human resources assistance, and other back-office functions that smaller districts may not have the capacity to handle independently. Springfield accesses a combination of menu-based and custom services across these areas.

### How Springfield SD 19 Purchases Services from Lane ESD

The relationship between Springfield SD 19 and Lane ESD is structured through a combination of menu services (standardized offerings available to all member districts) and custom services (tailored programs negotiated between the district and the ESD). Menu services are typically funded through the ESD's state allocation and are available at no additional charge to member districts. Custom services involve a separate contract and fee, negotiated based on the district's specific needs and the ESD's capacity to deliver. Board members should understand this distinction because it affects both the district's budget and the scope of services received. The board should ask questions about which services are menu-based (and therefore included) and which are custom (and therefore discretionary and budgeted separately).

### Local Service Plan — Board's Role in Review and Approval

The Local Service Plan (LSP) is the formal document that defines the services Lane ESD will provide to its member districts over a defined period (typically two years). The LSP outlines the menu of available services, the custom services offered, the funding model, and the expected deliverables. Oregon law requires that the LSP be reviewed and approved by each member district's board. For Springfield board members, the LSP review process is an important governance responsibility — it is the board's opportunity to evaluate whether the services proposed by Lane ESD align with the district's priorities and represent good value. The board should engage in meaningful review of the LSP rather than treating it as a routine approval, and should ask the superintendent to present a summary of the plan's key components and any changes from the prior cycle.

### Lane ESD Leadership and Regional Scope

Lane ESD is led by Superintendent Tony Scurto and serves all 16 school districts in Lane County, ranging from large urban districts to small rural communities. This regional scope gives Lane ESD the ability to coordinate services across district lines, share specialized staff, and advocate for Lane County's education interests at the state level. The ESD's board of directors is elected by voters within the ESD's boundaries and provides governance oversight of the agency's operations and budget. For Springfield board members, maintaining a productive relationship with Lane ESD — and understanding the broader regional context — is an important part of serving the district's students effectively.
