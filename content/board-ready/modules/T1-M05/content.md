## Overview

School board members are public officials. The moment you take the oath of office, you assume a set of legal and ethical obligations that go far beyond showing up to meetings and casting votes. Oregon law imposes specific requirements on public officials regarding conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, gift restrictions, and public accountability. These requirements exist to ensure that the public's business is conducted with integrity, transparency, and loyalty to the community — not to any private interest.

The Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC) is the state agency charged with overseeing and enforcing these standards. OGEC administers the conflict of interest laws, manages the financial disclosure system, investigates complaints, and provides guidance to public officials on ethical questions. Every school board member should know that OGEC exists, understand its role, and be familiar with the key rules it enforces. Ignorance of the ethics laws is not a defense — and violations can result in civil penalties, public embarrassment, and damage to the district's reputation.

Beyond formal legal requirements, board members carry a broader obligation of public accountability. The community entrusts its elected board members to act with honesty, fairness, and transparency. This trust is fragile. A single lapse in ethical judgment — a failure to disclose a conflict, an inappropriate use of public resources, a private conversation that should have occurred in public — can undermine years of good governance. Ethical board service requires constant vigilance, a willingness to ask hard questions about your own motives, and the courage to hold yourself and your colleagues accountable.

## Key Concepts

### Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC)

The Oregon Government Ethics Commission is the independent state agency responsible for ensuring that public officials — including school board members — conduct themselves ethically. OGEC administers Oregon's government ethics laws (ORS Chapter 244), which cover conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, gift restrictions, and the use of public office for private gain. OGEC investigates complaints filed against public officials, issues advisory opinions on ethical questions, and can impose civil penalties for violations. Board members should be aware that any member of the public can file a complaint with OGEC, and that complaints are investigated and adjudicated through a formal process. OGEC also provides training materials and guidance documents that are invaluable resources for new board members seeking to understand their obligations.

### Financial Disclosure Requirements

Oregon law requires certain public officials, including school board members in larger districts, to file annual Statements of Economic Interest (SEI) with OGEC. These statements disclose sources of income, business interests, real property holdings, and other financial information that could create conflicts of interest. The purpose is transparency — by making these disclosures public, the community can evaluate whether a board member's financial interests might influence their decision-making. Filing deadlines are strict, and failure to file on time can result in penalties. New board members should familiarize themselves with the SEI requirements promptly after taking office and establish a routine for timely filing. Even in districts where SEI filing is not legally required, voluntary disclosure is a strong practice that reinforces public trust.

### Conflicts of Interest — Identification and Recusal

Oregon ethics law distinguishes between two types of conflicts of interest. A **potential conflict** exists when a board member could benefit financially from a decision, but the benefit is shared with a large class of people (e.g., a tax measure that affects all property owners, including the board member). In this case, the member must publicly announce the potential conflict but may still participate and vote. An **actual conflict** exists when the decision would provide a direct, personal financial benefit to the member or a close relative that is distinct from the benefit to the general public. In this case, the member must publicly declare the conflict and **recuse themselves** — they may not participate in the discussion or vote. The critical skill for board members is learning to identify conflicts before they arise. When in doubt, consult with the district's legal counsel or OGEC directly. Failing to identify and properly handle a conflict of interest is one of the most common ethics violations among local elected officials.

### Personal Liability and Protections

Board members naturally worry about personal liability — the risk that their official actions could expose them to lawsuits or financial penalties. Oregon law provides significant protections. Under the Oregon Tort Claims Act (ORS Chapter 30), public bodies are generally required to defend and indemnify their officials for actions taken within the scope of their duties. However, these protections have limits. Board members who act outside the scope of their authority, engage in willful misconduct, or violate ethics laws may not be entitled to indemnification. The best protection against personal liability is straightforward: stay within your governance role, follow board policy, act in good faith, and comply with ethics requirements. Board members who govern responsibly and transparently have very little to worry about; those who overreach or cut corners expose themselves — and the district — to significant risk.

### Social Media Conduct as a Public Official

Social media is one of the most challenging areas of modern board service. Board members are citizens with free speech rights, but they are also public officials whose public statements carry weight and legal consequences. Social media posts by board members about district business may be subject to public records retention requirements. More critically, group discussions among board members on social media — even in private messages or group chats — can constitute a "meeting" under Oregon's public meeting laws if a quorum of members is involved. This means that a group text thread or Facebook conversation among four members of a seven-member board about a pending policy could be a violation of law. The safest approach is to treat social media as a one-way communication tool for sharing public information — meeting dates, community events, factual updates — and to reserve substantive policy discussion for the boardroom. When in doubt, do not post.
