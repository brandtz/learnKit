## Overview

School board members are public officials. The moment you take the oath of office, you assume a set of legal and ethical obligations that go far beyond showing up to meetings and casting votes. Oregon law imposes specific requirements on public officials regarding conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, gift restrictions, and public accountability. These requirements exist to ensure that the public's business is conducted with integrity, transparency, and loyalty to the community — not to any private interest.

The Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC) is the state agency charged with overseeing and enforcing these standards. OGEC administers the conflict of interest laws, manages the financial disclosure system, investigates complaints, and provides guidance to public officials on ethical questions. Every school board member should know that OGEC exists, understand its role, and be familiar with the key rules it enforces. Ignorance of the ethics laws is not a defense — and violations can result in civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation, public embarrassment, and lasting damage to the district's reputation.

Beyond formal legal requirements, board members carry a broader obligation of public accountability. The community entrusts its elected board members to act with honesty, fairness, and transparency. This trust is fragile. A single lapse in ethical judgment — a failure to disclose a conflict, an inappropriate use of public resources, a private conversation that should have occurred in public — can undermine years of good governance and distract the entire district from its mission of serving students.

This module provides a comprehensive guide to ethics, conflicts of interest, and accountability requirements for Oregon school board members, with practical guidance on navigating the gray areas you will inevitably encounter.

### The Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC)

OGEC is the independent state agency responsible for ensuring that Oregon's public officials — including all school board members — conduct themselves ethically. Established by the Oregon Legislature, OGEC has several key functions:

**Administration:** OGEC administers ORS Chapter 244 (Oregon Government Ethics law), which covers conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, gift restrictions, and use of public office. OGEC develops rules, publishes guidance documents, and maintains the financial disclosure filing system.

**Education:** OGEC provides training materials, online resources, and presentations for public officials. They offer advisory opinions — written guidance on specific ethical questions — that can protect you from enforcement action if you follow their advice. OGEC staff are available by phone and email to answer questions.

**Investigation:** Any member of the public can file a complaint with OGEC alleging an ethics violation by a public official. OGEC investigates these complaints through a formal process that includes fact-finding, opportunity for the official to respond, and a hearing before the commission if the matter is not resolved informally.

**Enforcement:** OGEC can impose civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. Penalties are not criminal — they are civil fines — but they are public record and can be professionally and personally devastating. OGEC can also issue letters of reprimand or education.

> **💡 Tip:** Bookmark the OGEC website (oregon.gov/ogec) and add their phone number to your contacts. When you encounter an ethical question — and you will — it is far better to call OGEC proactively for guidance than to guess and risk a violation. OGEC staff are helpful and respond promptly.

### ORS Chapter 244 — Oregon Government Ethics Law Explained

ORS Chapter 244 is the statutory framework governing ethics for all Oregon public officials. As a school board member, you are a "public official" under this law regardless of whether you are paid. The key provisions include:

#### ORS 244.020 — Definitions
This section defines critical terms including "public official," "relative," "business," "financial interest," and "legislative or administrative interest." Understanding these definitions is essential because the conflict of interest rules turn on them.

- **Public official:** Any person serving as an elected or appointed member of a public body, including school boards.
- **Relative:** Spouse, children, siblings, parents, spouse's parents, and any person for whom the official has a legal duty of support.
- **Business:** Any corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, trust, or other commercial entity in which the official or a relative holds a financial interest.

#### ORS 244.040 — Conflicts of Interest
This is the core provision. It prohibits public officials from using their official position to obtain financial benefits for themselves, relatives, or businesses with which they are associated. It requires disclosure and, in the case of actual conflicts, recusal.

#### ORS 244.025 — Gift Restrictions
Limits the gifts a public official may receive from any single source to $50 in a calendar year from sources with a legislative or administrative interest. This is discussed in detail below.

#### ORS 244.050 — Financial Interest in Public Contracts
Prohibits a public official from having a direct financial interest in any public contract made by the body on which the official serves. There are narrow exceptions for contracts under certain dollar amounts and for situations where the interest is disclosed and the official does not participate.

#### ORS 244.060 — Revolving Door Restrictions
Limits what a former public official may do after leaving office, particularly regarding lobbying and contracting with the public body they served.

#### ORS 244.350 — Statements of Economic Interest
Requires certain public officials to file annual financial disclosure statements. This is discussed in detail below.

### Conflicts of Interest: Actual vs. Potential

Understanding the difference between actual and potential conflicts is the most important practical skill in government ethics. Oregon law distinguishes clearly between the two, and the procedures for handling them are different.

#### Potential Conflict of Interest

A **potential conflict** exists when a board member could benefit financially from a decision, but the benefit is shared with a large class of people — not unique to the official.

**Examples:**
- The board votes on a tax levy that will affect all property owners in the district, including you as a homeowner.
- The board votes on health insurance benefits for all district employees, and your spouse works for the district.
- The board approves a contract with a vendor that serves many businesses in the community, including one where you are a customer (but not an owner or employee).

**Procedure for potential conflicts:**
1. Publicly announce the nature of the conflict before participating in any discussion or vote.
2. The announcement should be included in the meeting minutes.
3. You **may** participate in discussion and vote after making the announcement.

#### Actual Conflict of Interest

An **actual conflict** exists when a board decision would provide a direct, personal financial benefit to the member, a relative, or an associated business that is distinct from the benefit to the general public.

**Examples:**
- The board votes to award a construction contract to a company owned by your brother.
- The board votes on the superintendent's salary, and the superintendent is your spouse.
- The board considers purchasing property owned by your business partner.
- The board votes on a policy that would specifically benefit a business you own (e.g., requiring schools to purchase a product from your company).

**Procedure for actual conflicts:**
1. Publicly announce the nature of the conflict.
2. **Recuse yourself** from all discussion and voting on the matter.
3. The recusal must be recorded in the minutes.
4. Best practice: physically leave the room (or mute and turn off video if remote) during the discussion and vote to eliminate any appearance of influence.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board member has a potential conflict but, wanting to appear above reproach, recuses themselves. While well-intentioned, unnecessary recusal means the member's constituents lose their voice on that vote. Potential conflicts require disclosure, not recusal. Only actual conflicts require recusal. If you are unsure which type you have, consult OGEC or legal counsel before the meeting.

---

### The Declaration and Recusal Process — Step by Step

When you identify a conflict of interest (or even suspect one), follow this process:

**Before the meeting:**
1. Contact the superintendent or board chair to alert them to the potential issue.
2. If the situation is complex, consult OGEC or the district's legal counsel for an opinion.
3. Prepare a brief statement describing the nature of the conflict.

**During the meeting:**
1. When the item comes up on the agenda, request recognition from the chair.
2. State the conflict clearly: *"I need to declare a [potential/actual] conflict of interest on this item. I [describe the nature of the conflict — e.g., 'own property adjacent to the proposed school site' or 'my spouse is employed by the company bidding on this contract']."*
3. For a **potential conflict:** participate normally after the declaration.
4. For an **actual conflict:** state that you are recusing yourself, and physically leave the room or disconnect from the remote meeting until the item is concluded.

**After the meeting:**
- Verify that the minutes accurately reflect your declaration and (if applicable) recusal.
- Some board members also file a written conflict declaration with the board secretary for the permanent record.

> **💡 Tip:** When in doubt, declare. It is always better to disclose a potential conflict that turns out to be minor than to fail to disclose one that turns out to be significant. Transparency is your best protection.

### Financial Interest Disclosures — Statements of Economic Interest (SEI)

Oregon law requires certain public officials to file annual **Statements of Economic Interest (SEI)** with OGEC. The SEI requirement applies to:

- Board members in districts with annual budgets exceeding $1 million (which includes most Oregon school districts)
- Superintendents and other designated senior administrators

#### What Must Be Disclosed

The SEI requires disclosure of:
- Sources of income (employer names, not amounts) for you and your spouse
- Businesses in which you or your spouse hold a significant financial interest
- Real property owned in the district (other than your primary residence)
- Positions held in businesses or organizations (board memberships, partnerships, etc.)
- Names of clients if you are a professional (attorney, consultant, etc.) and any client has a legislative or administrative interest

#### Filing Deadlines and Penalties

- **New officials:** Must file within 30 days of taking office.
- **Annual filing:** Due by April 15 each year (covering the prior calendar year).
- **Late filing:** OGEC imposes automatic penalties for late filing — typically $10 per day, up to a maximum.
- **Failure to file:** Persistent failure to file can result in larger penalties and public notice.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A newly elected board member does not realize they need to file an SEI and misses the 30-day deadline. OGEC sends a reminder, then a notice, then imposes penalties. This is entirely avoidable — ask the superintendent's office about SEI filing requirements within your first week of office.

### Gifts and Meals — The $50 Annual Limit

Under **ORS 244.025**, a public official may not receive gifts with an aggregate value exceeding **$50 in a calendar year** from any single source that has a **legislative or administrative interest** — meaning the source lobbies, does business with, or could be affected by decisions of the board.

#### What Counts as a Gift

- Meals, drinks, and entertainment provided by vendors, contractors, or lobbyists
- Tickets to sporting events, concerts, or other entertainment
- Gift cards, merchandise, or promotional items above nominal value
- Travel, lodging, or event registration paid by a third party
- Free or discounted services from vendors

#### What Does NOT Count as a Gift

- Items available to the general public on the same terms (e.g., a free sample offered to everyone)
- Food or beverages at a reception or meal where the official is in attendance in their official capacity and the event is related to their public duties
- Gifts from relatives or personal friends unrelated to your official position
- Unsolicited awards or plaques of nominal value
- Campaign contributions (separate rules apply)
- Items received in your personal capacity unrelated to your role as a board member

#### The $50 Rule in Practice

The $50 limit is **per source, per calendar year**, and it is cumulative. If a textbook vendor buys you a $30 lunch in March and a $25 gift at a conference in October, you have exceeded the limit for that source.

| Scenario | Gift Value | Allowed? |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Vendor buys you coffee ($5) at a conference | $5 | Yes — under $50 |
| Same vendor later buys you dinner ($48) | $53 cumulative | No — exceeds $50 from one source |
| OSBA provides free registration at a conference | Depends on source | Likely allowed if from a governmental entity or nonprofit providing education |
| A parent gives you a holiday gift worth $40 | $40 | Likely allowed — a parent is not typically a "source with a legislative or administrative interest" unless they are also a vendor or contractor |

> **💡 Tip:** Keep a simple log of gifts received, noting the source, date, and estimated value. When the $50 limit approaches for any source, decline further gifts politely: *"I appreciate the offer, but ethics rules limit the gifts I can accept. I'll need to pass."*

### Nepotism Rules

Oregon ethics law and most board policies restrict nepotism — using your official position to benefit relatives in employment or contracting. Key rules:

- A board member may not participate in hiring, evaluating, or supervising a relative.
- Board policy typically prohibits the employment of a board member's immediate family member in a position that reports to the board or superintendent without disclosure and safeguards.
- If a relative applies for a district position, the board member should disclose the relationship and recuse from any discussion or vote related to the hiring.
- The superintendent should handle the hiring decision through the normal process, and the board member should not be involved in any way.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board member's adult child applies for a teaching position in the district. The board member does not disclose the relationship because they believe "the superintendent handles hiring, so it doesn't involve me." But if the superintendent feels pressured — even implicitly — by the board member's presence, the hiring process is compromised. Always disclose, even if you believe you have no formal role in the decision.

---

### Use of Office for Personal Gain

**ORS 244.040(1)** prohibits a public official from using or attempting to use their official position or office to obtain a financial benefit or to avoid a financial detriment for themselves, a relative, or a business with which they are associated, if the opportunity would not otherwise be available but for the position.

**Examples of prohibited conduct:**
- Using your board member title to get a discount from a vendor that does business with the district
- Directing district staff to provide services to your personal business
- Using confidential information gained through your board service (such as knowledge of an upcoming land purchase) for personal financial advantage
- Pressuring the superintendent to hire your friend's company
- Using district equipment, supplies, or facilities for personal purposes

**Examples that are generally permissible:**
- Using your board member title in a biography or resume (factual statement, not leveraging)
- Accepting the same publicly available services that any community member could access
- Sharing general, non-confidential information with community members about district plans

> **💡 Tip:** Apply the "newspaper test" — if a reporter wrote a story about what you did, would it look like you used your office for personal benefit? If the answer is even "maybe," reconsider.

---

### Public Records and Transparency Obligations

As a public official, you are subject to Oregon's public records law (**ORS 192.311–192.478**). Key points:

- **Emails and text messages** about district business on your personal devices are public records. They must be retained and produced if someone files a public records request.
- **Social media posts** about district business may be public records.
- **Board packets, reports, and documents** provided to you as a board member are public records.
- **Executive session discussions** are exempt from public records disclosure, but the fact that an executive session occurred and the topic discussed are public.
- **You cannot delete** public records to avoid disclosure. Destruction of public records can result in criminal penalties.

**Practical guidance:**
- Use your district-provided email for all board-related communication when possible.
- If you use personal email or text for district business, retain those messages and forward them to your district account for archiving.
- When in doubt about whether something is a public record, assume it is and preserve it.
- If you receive a public records request, immediately notify the superintendent, who will coordinate the response through the district's records process.

---

### Social Media Conduct for Board Members

Social media presents unique ethical and legal challenges for board members:

- **Public meetings law:** If a quorum of board members discusses board business on social media (even in a private group or direct messages), it may constitute an unlawful public meeting. This applies to Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, group texts, WhatsApp, Slack — any platform.
- **Public records:** Your social media posts about district business may be subject to public records requests and retention requirements.
- **Defamation risk:** Statements about individual staff members, students, or community members that are false and damaging can create personal liability — social media does not provide any special protection.
- **Perception:** The public often cannot distinguish between your personal opinion and the board's official position. A post that says "I think we should fire the superintendent" will be read as the board attacking the superintendent, even if it is labeled as personal opinion.

**Best practices:**
- Do not discuss pending board business on social media
- Do not engage in social media arguments about district issues
- Use social media for sharing factual information: meeting dates, community events, celebrations
- If you must share an opinion, clearly label it: *"Speaking personally, not on behalf of the board..."*
- Never discuss individual students or employees on social media
- Do not participate in group chats or threads with other board members about district business

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Three members of a seven-member board participate in a Facebook discussion thread about whether to close a school. Even though it is a public Facebook post, this constitutes a quorum discussing board business outside a noticed meeting — a potential violation of public meetings law. The conversation should have happened in the boardroom.

---

### Whistleblower Protections

Oregon law provides protections for public employees who report misconduct, but board members should also understand these protections:

- **ORS 659A.200–659A.224** protects employees who report in good faith what they reasonably believe to be a violation of law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial danger to public health and safety.
- The board, as the governing body, may receive whistleblower complaints — particularly about the superintendent, since the board is the superintendent's employer.
- The board must not retaliate against whistleblowers or allow the superintendent to do so.
- If a whistleblower complaint is filed, the board should consult legal counsel immediately to ensure proper handling.
- Board members themselves are also protected if they report misconduct within the district.

> **💡 Tip:** If a district employee contacts you with a concern about potential misconduct, listen and take it seriously. Do not promise confidentiality (you may not be able to guarantee it), but do promise that the district will investigate and that retaliation is prohibited. Immediately consult with the board chair and legal counsel about next steps.

---

### Board Member Recall Process

Oregon law (**ORS 249.865–249.880**) provides a mechanism for voters to recall elected officials, including school board members. Key points:

- Any registered voter in the district may file a recall petition.
- The petition must state the reason for recall. Any reason is legally sufficient — Oregon does not require "cause."
- If sufficient signatures are gathered (typically 15% of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in the district), a recall election is held.
- If a majority of voters support recall, the official is removed from office.
- The recalled official may run for the same office in the subsequent election to fill the vacancy.
- Recall elections are rare but do occur in Oregon — usually triggered by extreme public dissatisfaction with a board member's conduct, votes, or attendance.

The best defense against recall is consistent, ethical, transparent service. Board members who communicate clearly, follow the law, and act in the public interest rarely face recall efforts.

### Real Examples of Ethics Violations by Oregon Public Officials

These anonymized examples illustrate common violations:

**Case 1 — Undisclosed Conflict of Interest:** A board member in a mid-size Oregon district voted to approve a technology contract with a company where the member's spouse worked as a sales representative. The member did not disclose the relationship. A community member filed a complaint with OGEC. The commission found an actual conflict of interest and imposed a $1,500 civil penalty.

**Case 2 — Gift Limit Violation:** An Oregon school administrator accepted multiple meals and event tickets from a curriculum vendor over the course of a year, totaling approximately $300. When the district adopted that vendor's curriculum, a competing vendor filed a complaint. OGEC found the administrator had exceeded the $50 gift limit and imposed a $750 penalty.

**Case 3 — Use of Office for Personal Gain:** A board member in an eastern Oregon district used their board email and title to solicit business for their private consulting firm from companies that did business with the district. OGEC found this constituted use of official position for personal financial benefit and imposed a $3,000 penalty.

**Case 4 — Failure to File SEI:** A board member in a Portland-area district repeatedly failed to file their Statement of Economic Interest despite multiple reminders from OGEC. The commission imposed cumulative late-filing penalties totaling $1,800 over two years.

These cases illustrate that OGEC enforcement is real, that community members and competitors do file complaints, and that penalties can be significant.

---

### How to Seek an Advisory Opinion from OGEC

One of the most valuable and underused resources available to board members is the **OGEC advisory opinion**. Here is how it works:

1. **Contact OGEC** by phone, email, or through their website to describe your situation.
2. **Provide the relevant facts** — be specific and honest about the circumstances.
3. **OGEC staff will research** the issue and provide written guidance — typically within a few weeks.
4. **An advisory opinion protects you.** If you follow OGEC's advice in good faith, you cannot be penalized for the action covered by the opinion, even if the commission later changes its interpretation.
5. Advisory opinions may be issued as **staff advisory opinions** (quick, less formal) or **commission advisory opinions** (formal, issued by the full commission).

> **💡 Tip:** Request advisory opinions proactively — before you encounter the conflict, not after. If you know you will be voting on a matter that could involve a conflict, contact OGEC a month in advance. Getting written guidance before the vote is infinitely better than defending yourself after a complaint.

---

### Annual Ethics Training Requirements

Oregon law and OSBA best practices establish training requirements for board members:

- **ORS 244.320** authorizes OGEC to require training for public officials. OGEC encourages (and in some cases requires) elected officials to complete government ethics training within the first year of taking office and periodically thereafter.
- **OSBA recommends** annual training on ethics, public meetings law, and public records for all board members.
- **Many board policies** require annual ethics training as a condition of board service.
- **Training is available** from multiple sources: OGEC's online training modules, OSBA workshops and webinars, and the district's legal counsel.

What training should cover:
- Conflicts of interest (actual and potential) and the declaration/recusal process
- Gift restrictions and the $50 limit
- Financial disclosure (SEI) requirements and deadlines
- Use of office restrictions
- Public meetings law (ORS 192.610–192.690)
- Public records law (ORS 192.311–192.478)
- Executive session rules and confidentiality
- Social media conduct

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A veteran board member skips ethics training because they have "been doing this for years." Ethics laws change; OGEC interpretations evolve; new court decisions create new obligations. Annual training is not just for new members — it is a requirement for effective, legally compliant service at every stage of your career.

---
