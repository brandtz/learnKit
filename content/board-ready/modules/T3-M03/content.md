## Overview

Springfield Public Schools faces a projected **$10.4 million budget deficit** for the 2026–27 fiscal year — a shortfall of roughly **7.4%** on a general fund budget of approximately $140 million. This is not a surprise event; it is the predictable consequence of structural forces that have been building for years. Every board member must understand the origins of this gap, the realistic options for closing it, and the legal and political dynamics that will shape every decision between now and the June budget adoption deadline.

This module walks through the deficit in detail — root causes, the Oregon funding context, the board's fiduciary role, and the practical choices ahead.

---

### The Scale of the Problem

A $10.4 million shortfall is not an abstraction. To put it in human terms:

- **~80–100 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions** if addressed entirely through staffing reductions (at an average loaded cost of $105,000–$130,000 per FTE, depending on role and benefits)
- **Equivalent to closing 2–3 elementary schools** in terms of operational savings
- **Roughly $1,500 per student** across the district's approximately 10,000 enrolled students

The general fund is the district's primary operating account. It pays for salaries, benefits, instructional materials, utilities, transportation, and most day-to-day costs. Unlike capital funds (which are restricted to facilities), the general fund is where the pain of a deficit is felt most directly — in classrooms, staffing ratios, and program availability.

| Category | 2025–26 Adopted | 2026–27 Projected | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Revenue** | $139.8M | $137.2M | –$2.6M |
| **Total Expenditures** | $141.5M | $147.6M | +$6.1M |
| **Projected Gap** | –$1.7M | **–$10.4M** | –$8.7M |
| **Ending Fund Balance** | $8.2M | –$2.2M (deficit) | — |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes assume the deficit is a single-year problem. It is not. Without structural changes, the gap widens in 2027–28 and beyond because the cost drivers — PERS rates, health insurance, and step/column increases — are compounding while revenue remains essentially flat on a per-pupil basis.

---

### Root Causes of the Deficit

The $10.4 million gap does not have a single cause. It is the product of at least six converging forces:

#### 1. Declining Enrollment

Springfield's K–12 enrollment has dropped by approximately **800–1,000 students** over the past five years (as of the most recent available data). Oregon's State School Fund is distributed on a per-pupil basis through the ADMw (Average Daily Membership, weighted) formula. Fewer students = fewer dollars.

Key enrollment pressures include:
- Declining birth rates in Lane County
- Housing affordability driving families out of the district
- Growth of charter schools and home schooling post-COVID
- Competition from neighboring districts (Eugene 4J, Bethel)

Each lost student represents approximately **$10,000–$11,000** in State School Fund revenue at current funding levels.

#### 2. Flat State Funding Per-Pupil

Oregon's State School Fund — the single largest source of revenue for Springfield — has not kept pace with inflation. While the Legislature has increased the total fund in recent biennia, those increases have been consumed by:
- PERS cost shifts from the state to districts
- Enrollment growth in other parts of the state (Portland suburbs, Central Oregon)
- Inflation that outpaces nominal funding increases

In real (inflation-adjusted) dollars, Oregon per-pupil funding remains **below 2008 pre-recession levels** — a fact that shapes every budget conversation.

#### 3. The ESSER Cliff

The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds — federal COVID-era dollars — expired on **September 30, 2024**. Springfield received approximately **$30–35 million** in total ESSER allocations across three rounds (ESSER I, II, and III). While the district was careful not to use ESSER for permanent staffing, some positions and programs supported by those funds have not been fully replaced by ongoing revenue.

The three rounds of ESSER funding had different timelines and spending requirements:

| Round | Approximate Amount | Deadline | Primary Uses |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESSER I (CARES Act) | ~$4–5M | Sept 2022 | PPE, sanitization, devices, emergency staffing |
| ESSER II (CRRSA) | ~$10–12M | Sept 2023 | Learning loss, ventilation, mental health |
| ESSER III (ARP) | ~$18–22M | Sept 2024 | Extended learning, tutoring, summer programs, staffing |

Programs at risk include:
- Summer learning and extended-year programs
- Additional counselors and mental health staff hired during the pandemic
- Tutoring and intervention programs — particularly the high-dosage tutoring models shown to be effective in recovering pandemic learning loss
- Technology refresh cycles accelerated with ESSER dollars
- Supplemental curriculum materials and intervention resources
- Additional custodial and facilities improvements that maintained healthier learning environments

The ESSER cliff is particularly painful because many of these programs were **demonstrably effective**. Cutting them is not a reflection of their value — it is a reflection of the district's inability to sustain one-time federal funding levels with ongoing state and local revenue.

#### 4. Rising Personnel Costs

Personnel costs (salaries + benefits) account for approximately **85%** of the general fund budget. Three specific cost drivers are accelerating:

- **PERS (Public Employees Retirement System) employer rates:** Springfield's blended PERS rate has climbed from approximately 25% of payroll five years ago to over **30%** currently, with further increases projected. (See the PERS section below for detail.)
- **Health insurance:** The district's contribution to employee health insurance has increased at 6–10% annually in recent years — far outpacing revenue growth.
- **Step and column increases:** Under existing collective bargaining agreements, most employees receive annual step increases (longevity) and may also receive column increases (education credits). These "cost of continuing current operations" increases add roughly **2–3%** to the salary base each year even without any new negotiated raises.

#### 5. Inflation on Non-Personnel Costs

Energy, fuel, food service supplies, instructional materials, and contracted services have all experienced significant inflation since 2021. While non-personnel costs are only ~15% of the budget, even a 5–8% annual increase on a $20 million base adds over $1 million per year.

#### 6. Deferred Maintenance and Operational Pressures

Years of tight budgets have pushed maintenance, technology replacement, and curriculum adoption cycles behind schedule. While these are often funded from other sources, the general fund increasingly absorbs costs that cannot wait.

> 💡 **Tip:** When constituents ask "where did the money go?" — the honest answer is: costs went up faster than revenue, and federal one-time money ran out. There is no single villain. Board members who can explain this clearly will build more public trust than those who point fingers.

### Oregon School Funding Context

Understanding Springfield's deficit requires understanding how Oregon funds schools.

#### The State School Fund (SSF)

Oregon uses a **formula-based funding model** established by Measure 5 (1990) and the school funding reforms of the 1990s (HB 3565, Measure 50). The key features:

- **Property taxes are capped** at $5 per $1,000 of assessed value for school operations (Measure 5, 1990) and assessed value growth is capped at 3% per year (Measure 50, 1997).
- **The State School Fund "equalizes"** funding by combining state income tax revenue with local property tax revenue and distributing it on a per-pupil weighted basis (ADMw).
- **Weights** adjust funding for student characteristics: poverty, English language learners, students in foster care, students with disabilities, small school/remote factors, etc.
- The Legislature sets the total SSF amount each biennium. For the current 2025–27 biennium, the total fund is approximately **$10.2 billion** (as of the most recent available data).

#### Why Oregon Chronically Underfunds Education

Oregon's Quality Education Model (QEM) — a statutory model that estimates the cost of meeting the state's own educational goals — has consistently shown a **$2–4 billion gap** between what the Legislature funds and what is needed. Reasons include:

- Revenue competition with other state priorities (Medicaid, corrections, human services)
- Kicker law (ORS 291.349) returns surplus income tax revenue to taxpayers rather than allowing it to fund services
- No statewide sales tax, limiting the revenue base
- PERS costs consuming an increasing share of education dollars before they reach classrooms

#### Local Option Levies

Districts may ask voters to approve a **local option levy** (ORS 280.040–280.145) to supplement State School Fund revenue. Springfield currently has a local option levy that generates approximately **$12–15 million per year**. The current levy is set to expire — and renewal or replacement will be a critical board decision. (See the levy section below.)

---

### PERS: The Elephant in the Budget

The **Public Employees Retirement System (PERS)** is Oregon's defined-benefit pension system for public employees, including school district staff. It is one of the single largest cost pressures facing Springfield and every other Oregon district.

#### How PERS Affects School Budgets

- The district pays an **employer contribution rate** as a percentage of each employee's salary. This rate is set by the PERS Board every two years based on actuarial valuations.
- Springfield's blended employer rate (Tier 1/Tier 2 and OPSRP combined) is approximately **30–33%** of covered payroll (as of the most recent available data).
- On a payroll of roughly $85–90 million, that translates to **$25–30 million per year** in PERS contributions alone.
- Rate increases of even 1–2 percentage points add **$850K–$1.8M** in annual cost.

#### The Unfunded Liability

Oregon PERS carries a system-wide **unfunded actuarial liability (UAL)** that has been estimated at **$23–27 billion** in recent valuations. Springfield's allocated share of this liability is substantial. Districts are required to make payments toward the UAL as part of their employer rate — meaning a portion of every payroll dollar goes to paying down past pension promises, not funding current services.

Legislative reforms (SB 1049 in 2019) modestly reduced the rate trajectory, but PERS remains a structural cost driver that boards cannot directly control.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** New board members sometimes propose "opting out of PERS" or "switching to a 401(k)." This is not legally available to districts. PERS participation is mandated by state law (ORS Chapter 238, 238A). Advocacy for reform must occur at the state legislative level.

### Historical Budget Trajectory

Springfield's budget trajectory over the past five years illustrates the structural squeeze:

| Fiscal Year | General Fund Revenue | General Fund Expenditures | Ending Fund Balance | Enrollment (ADMr) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2022–23 | $132.5M | $130.8M | $11.4M | ~10,600 |
| 2023–24 | $136.1M | $135.7M | $10.1M | ~10,350 |
| 2024–25 | $138.0M | $139.2M | $8.9M | ~10,150 |
| 2025–26 | $139.8M | $141.5M | $8.2M | ~10,000 |
| 2026–27 (proj.) | $137.2M | $147.6M | **–$2.2M** | ~9,800 |

*Figures are approximate and reflect general fund only, as of the most recent available data.*

The pattern is unmistakable: revenues are growing slowly (1–2% per year), expenditures are growing faster (3–5% per year), and the fund balance — the district's savings cushion — has been steadily drawn down.

> 💡 **Tip:** A healthy ending fund balance for a district of Springfield's size is generally considered to be **5–8%** of expenditures (roughly $7–12 million). Dropping below 5% signals financial distress and may trigger concern from auditors and credit rating agencies.

---

### General Fund Expenditure Breakdown

Understanding where the money goes is essential to understanding why cuts are so difficult. The general fund breaks down approximately as follows:

| Expenditure Category | Approximate % | Approximate $ (2026–27) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Licensed staff salaries | ~38% | ~$56M | Teachers, counselors, librarians, specialists |
| Classified staff salaries | ~15% | ~$22M | EAs, secretaries, custodians, bus drivers |
| Administrative salaries | ~7% | ~$10M | Principals, district office administrators |
| PERS employer contributions | ~18% | ~$27M | Includes UAL payments |
| Health insurance | ~10% | ~$15M | Medical, dental, vision for employees |
| Other benefits (payroll taxes, workers' comp) | ~3% | ~$4.5M | FICA, unemployment, workers' compensation |
| Purchased services | ~4% | ~$6M | Utilities, contracted services, legal, audit |
| Supplies and materials | ~3% | ~$4.5M | Instructional materials, office supplies, tech |
| Capital outlay (from general fund) | ~1% | ~$1.5M | Equipment, minor renovations |
| Other (transfers, contingency) | ~1% | ~$1.5M | Transfers to other funds, contingency reserve |
| **Total** | **100%** | **~$147.6M** | — |

The overwhelming dominance of personnel costs (salaries + benefits = ~85%) explains why significant budget reductions inevitably involve staffing. A district cannot cut its way to a $10.4 million savings through supplies, utilities, and contracts alone — those categories simply are not large enough.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Community members and even some board members will suggest cutting "administration" as the primary solution. While administrative efficiency matters, total administrative salaries represent only ~7% of the budget. Eliminating every administrator in the district — an impossibility — would not close a $10.4 million gap. Board members should be honest about this math, even when it is politically inconvenient.

---

### What $10.4 Million in Cuts Looks Like

If the deficit were addressed **entirely** through expenditure reductions, the impact would be severe:

- **80–100 FTE positions eliminated** (teachers, educational assistants, classified staff, administrators)
- **Class sizes increasing by 3–5 students** per section at all levels
- **Elimination of multiple elective programs** (music, art, world languages, or CTE sections)
- **Reduction or elimination of summer school**, extended-year services, and intervention programs
- **Cuts to transportation** (route consolidation, increased walk zones)
- **Deferral of curriculum adoptions** and instructional materials purchases
- **Reduction in custodial, maintenance, and IT support** staff

In practice, districts never address a deficit through a single strategy. The board will need to consider a **portfolio of approaches** — some painful, some creative, some requiring voter support.

---

### The Budget Development Process

Oregon law (ORS 294.305–294.565, the Local Budget Law) prescribes a detailed process for school district budgets:

| Milestone | Typical Timeline | Key Action |
|---|---|---|
| Superintendent's budget development | January–March | Staff develops proposed budget; identifies reductions |
| Budget Committee appointed | By March | Board appoints citizen members (equal to board size) |
| Proposed budget delivered | Late March/April | Superintendent presents to Budget Committee |
| Budget Committee meetings | April–May | Committee reviews, asks questions, deliberates |
| Budget Committee approval | May | Committee approves the budget; may make changes |
| Public hearing | May–June | Required public hearing before board adoption |
| Board adoption | By June 30 | Board adopts the budget and appropriates funds |
| Tax certification | By July 15 | District certifies tax levy with Lane County |

The **Budget Committee** is a critical body. It consists of the board members plus an equal number of community members appointed by the board. The Budget Committee reviews the superintendent's proposed budget and must approve it before it goes to the board for final adoption.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes treat the Budget Committee as a rubber stamp. Oregon law gives the Budget Committee real authority — it can modify the proposed budget, and the board cannot adopt a budget that exceeds what the Budget Committee approved (ORS 294.431). Take these meetings seriously.

---

### The Board's Role in the Budget

The board's budget role is **governance, not management**:

- **Approve the budget** — The board has final adoption authority (ORS 294.456).
- **Set priorities** — The board should communicate its values and priorities to the superintendent *before* the budget is built, not after.
- **Appoint Budget Committee members** — Choose community members who bring diverse perspectives and financial literacy.
- **Fiduciary duty** — Board members have a legal obligation to ensure the district remains fiscally solvent. Approving an unbalanced budget or depleting reserves recklessly can expose the board to legal and political risk.
- **Communicate with the public** — Board members are the elected representatives of the community. During budget crises, they must be visible, honest, and accessible.

What the board should **not** do:
- Decide which specific positions to cut (that's the superintendent's job)
- Negotiate directly with unions over budget-related concessions
- Promise the public that specific programs will be saved before the budget process is complete

---

### Options for Addressing the Deficit

The board and administration will evaluate a range of strategies:

#### A. Expenditure Reductions

| Strategy | Potential Savings | Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| Staffing reductions (attrition + RIF) | $4–8M | Largest lever; most painful; affects classrooms |
| Administrative consolidation | $500K–$1.5M | Politically popular but limited savings |
| Program reductions/eliminations | $1–3M | Affects students directly; community backlash likely |
| Supply and materials cuts | $200–500K | Limited impact; already lean |
| Deferred maintenance | $300–700K | Risky; creates future liability |
| Transportation route consolidation | $300–600K | Affects families; equity concerns |

#### B. Revenue Enhancements

- **Local option levy renewal/increase:** If the current levy is expiring, a renewal at a higher rate could generate additional revenue. Requires voter approval. (See below.)
- **Bond restructuring:** May free up some capacity, but bonds are restricted to capital purposes and cannot fund operations.
- **Grants and partnerships:** Competitive grants (federal, state, foundation) can offset specific costs but are not reliable for structural gaps.
- **Facility rentals and shared services:** Modest revenue potential.

#### C. Operational Efficiencies

- Energy management and utility savings
- Cooperative purchasing with neighboring districts
- Technology consolidation
- Renegotiating vendor contracts

#### D. Fund Balance Usage

The district can draw down its ending fund balance to partially bridge the gap — but this is a **one-time** strategy, not a structural solution. Using reserves buys time but does not fix the underlying imbalance.

> 💡 **Tip:** The most credible deficit reduction plans use a **combination** of strategies. A plan that relies too heavily on any single approach — whether cuts alone or levy revenue alone — is fragile and politically vulnerable.

---

### The Local Option Levy

A **local option levy** is a voter-approved property tax that supplements the State School Fund. Key details:

- Authorized under **ORS 280.040–280.145**
- Limited to **$1.50 per $1,000 of assessed value** for school districts
- Requires simple majority voter approval at a regular or special election
- Typically authorized for **5 years**
- Springfield's current levy generates approximately **$12–15 million annually** (as of the most recent available data)

If the levy expires without renewal, the district would face an **additional** $12–15 million shortfall on top of the projected deficit — a catastrophic scenario. Levy renewal is therefore not just desirable but **essential** to the district's financial viability.

Board members play a critical role in levy campaigns:
- The board can authorize placing the measure on the ballot
- Individual board members may advocate for the levy as private citizens
- **The district may not use public funds to advocate** for or against a ballot measure (ORS 260.432) — but it may provide factual information

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Confusing a levy with a bond. A **levy** funds operations (salaries, programs, day-to-day costs). A **bond** funds capital projects (buildings, equipment). They are separate measures with separate legal authority and separate tax rates. Board members must be precise in public communications.

---

### Impact on Collective Bargaining

Springfield's employees are represented by collective bargaining units — the Springfield Education Association (SEA) for licensed staff and OSEA/classified unions for support staff. Budget deficits interact with bargaining in several ways:

- **Cost of continuing current agreements** must be budgeted before any new proposals are considered
- **Reopener clauses** in existing contracts may allow either party to renegotiate compensation mid-contract if financial conditions change
- **Reductions in force (RIF)** are governed by contract language and Oregon law (ORS 342.934) — seniority, licensure, and specific procedural requirements apply
- The board should **not** negotiate directly — that is the superintendent's (or designee's) role under ORS 243.650–243.782 (Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act)
- The board must **ratify** any tentative agreement reached at the bargaining table

Budget crises often coincide with difficult bargaining. Board members should understand that employee groups will advocate strongly for their members — that is their legal right. The board's job is to balance employee needs with fiscal sustainability and student outcomes.

---

### Community Engagement

Communicating a $10.4 million deficit to the community is one of the hardest tasks a board will face. Best practices:

- **Be transparent early.** Share budget projections as soon as they are available — don't wait until cuts are proposed.
- **Use plain language.** Avoid jargon. Say "we need to cut the equivalent of 90 teaching positions" rather than "we must reduce FTE by 90."
- **Hold multiple public forums** in different locations and at different times to maximize access.
- **Provide written materials** (fact sheets, FAQ documents, budget summaries) in English and Spanish.
- **Use the district website and social media** to share information and answer questions.
- **Listen.** Community engagement is not just about telling — it's about hearing what the community values most.
- **Acknowledge the pain.** Don't sugarcoat the choices. People respect honesty.

> 💡 **Tip:** The best-run budget processes in Oregon share a common feature: the superintendent and board communicate the same message. Mixed signals — where one board member says "everything's fine" while another says "the sky is falling" — destroy public trust. Align your messaging before going public.

---

### What Other Oregon Districts Have Done

Springfield is not alone. Several comparable Oregon districts have faced similar structural deficits:

- **Eugene 4J:** Faced a $12 million deficit in 2023–24. Addressed it through a combination of staffing reductions (~70 FTE), program consolidation, school closures/consolidations, and a successful local option levy. The school closure process was politically painful and took two years.
- **Salem-Keizer:** The state's second-largest district has dealt with chronic budget shortfalls, using a combination of RIFs, administrative reductions, and state emergency funding. Successfully passed a levy after a prior failure.
- **Bend-La Pine:** Rapid enrollment growth followed by a plateau created budget stress. Addressed through careful enrollment projection, boundary adjustments, and levy funding.

Common lessons:
1. **Early and honest communication** with the community is essential.
2. **Multi-year planning** (not just one-year fixes) builds credibility.
3. **Levy campaigns** require sustained community engagement — starting 12–18 months before the election.
4. **School closures**, if needed, should be approached through a transparent, criteria-based process.

---

### Board Member Responsibilities During Budget Crises

As a board member during a deficit, your responsibilities include:

1. **Fulfill your fiduciary duty** — Ensure the district does not adopt a budget it cannot fund. An unbalanced budget violates Oregon Local Budget Law.
2. **Set clear priorities** — Tell the superintendent what you value (e.g., "protect classroom instruction," "maintain equity commitments," "preserve CTE") and let the administration build a budget that reflects those priorities.
3. **Avoid micromanagement** — Do not dictate specific cuts. The board sets policy and direction; the superintendent manages operations.
4. **Communicate with constituents** — Be accessible, honest, and consistent. Attend public forums. Return emails and phone calls.
5. **Support the superintendent** — Budget crises are stressful for everyone. The board should provide clear direction and political cover, not second-guess every decision publicly.
6. **Maintain board unity** — A divided board during a budget crisis invites chaos. Disagree in the boardroom, but support the final decision publicly.
7. **Think long-term** — Resist the temptation to use one-time fixes (reserves, grants) to avoid structural changes. A sustainable budget requires structural solutions.

---

### Scenario Planning

The administration should present the board with **multiple scenarios**:

| Scenario | Assumptions | Deficit | Key Actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best Case** | Enrollment stabilizes; state adds funding; levy passes at higher rate | ~$4M | Modest reductions + levy revenue |
| **Most Likely** | Enrollment declines slightly; state funding flat; levy renews at current rate | ~$10.4M | Significant reductions + levy renewal + efficiencies |
| **Worst Case** | Enrollment drops sharply; state funding cut; levy fails | ~$18–22M | Deep cuts; possible school closures; financial emergency |

A board that plans for the worst case and hopes for the best case is a board that will not be caught off guard.

---

### Key Budget Milestones — 2026–27 Cycle

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| January 2026 | Superintendent begins budget development; preliminary projections shared with board |
| February 2026 | Board provides budget priorities and direction to superintendent |
| March 2026 | Budget Committee members appointed; proposed budget under development |
| April 2026 | Superintendent presents proposed budget to Budget Committee |
| April–May 2026 | Budget Committee meetings (minimum 2; typically 3–5) |
| May 2026 | Budget Committee approves proposed budget |
| May–June 2026 | Required public hearing on approved budget |
| June 2026 | Board adopts budget and makes appropriations |
| July 15, 2026 | Tax levy certified to Lane County Assessor |
| July 1, 2026 | New fiscal year begins |

---

### Summary

The $10.4 million projected deficit is the most significant financial challenge Springfield Public Schools has faced in a decade. It is driven by structural forces — declining enrollment, flat state funding, the ESSER cliff, and rising personnel costs — that will not resolve themselves. The board's role is to set priorities, ensure fiscal responsibility, communicate honestly with the community, and support the superintendent in developing a sustainable budget. There are no easy answers, but there are responsible ones.

Every decision the board makes in the next six months will shape the district's capacity to serve students for years to come. Take the time to understand the numbers, ask hard questions, and make principled choices.
