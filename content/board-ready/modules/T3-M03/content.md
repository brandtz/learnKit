## Overview

Springfield School District 19 is facing a projected budget deficit of approximately $10.4 million for the 2026-27 school year. This shortfall was formally presented at the February 12 Budget Committee Work Session and represents the most significant fiscal challenge confronting the district and its board of directors. For any new or prospective board member, understanding the scale, causes, and potential responses to this deficit is essential to responsible governance.

The deficit is not the result of a single decision or event but rather reflects structural pressures common across Oregon school districts. The primary driver is Oregon's enrollment-based funding model: the State School Fund allocates dollars to districts based on a metric called ADMw — Average Daily Membership, weighted. When enrollment declines, as it has in many Oregon districts in recent years, revenue declines with it. At the same time, operational costs — salaries, benefits, transportation, facilities maintenance — continue to rise. The gap between declining revenue and rising costs produces the kind of structural deficit Springfield now faces.

The budget process in Oregon is governed by state law and administrative rule, and it follows a defined annual timeline. The budget committee, which is composed of all board members plus an equal number of appointed community members, is responsible for reviewing the superintendent's proposed budget, holding public hearings, and approving a budget for submission to the board. The budget committee process typically runs from January through June, with the board giving final approval before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1. This means that the 2026-27 deficit will be the central topic of budget committee work throughout the spring of 2026.

Board members do not manage the budget day to day — that is the superintendent's responsibility. But the board sets priorities, approves the final budget, and is ultimately accountable to the community for how public dollars are spent. Understanding the budget is not optional; it is one of the board's most consequential governance duties.

## Key Concepts

### The $10.4 Million Projected Deficit

The projected $10.4 million deficit for the 2026-27 school year represents the gap between anticipated revenues and projected expenditures. This figure was presented to the budget committee at the February 12 Work Session and reflects the district's best current estimates based on enrollment trends, state funding projections, and known cost obligations. A deficit of this magnitude is significant — it represents a substantial percentage of the district's total general fund budget and cannot be addressed through minor adjustments alone. The board and budget committee will need to consider a range of options, potentially including some combination of expenditure reductions and new revenue strategies.

### Oregon's Enrollment-Driven Funding Model (ADMw)

Oregon funds its public schools primarily through the State School Fund (SSF), which distributes money to districts based on ADMw — Average Daily Membership, weighted. ADMw takes the district's student headcount and applies weights for factors such as poverty, English language learner status, special education needs, and other categories. The key implication is straightforward: when enrollment declines, funding declines. Oregon's funding model does not guarantee a fixed dollar amount per district; it guarantees a formula-driven share of the total state allocation. This means that districts experiencing enrollment loss — as many have since the COVID-19 pandemic — face revenue reductions even as their fixed costs remain stable or increase.

### The Budget Committee: Composition and Role

Oregon law requires every school district to have a budget committee composed of all members of the board of directors plus an equal number of community members appointed by the board. For Springfield's five-member board, this means the budget committee has ten total members (five board members plus five community appointees). The budget committee reviews the superintendent's proposed budget, asks questions, holds public hearings, and ultimately approves a budget that the board then formally adopts. This structure ensures that the community has a direct voice in the most consequential financial decisions the district makes each year.

### Common Deficit Response Strategies

When a district faces a significant budget shortfall, the options available generally fall into a few categories. Expenditure reductions may include program cuts, staff reductions (layoffs or attrition), consolidation of services, or renegotiation of contracts. Revenue strategies may include seeking a voter-approved local option levy, drawing on financial reserves (ending fund balance), or pursuing grants and partnerships. Each option carries trade-offs — staff reductions affect classrooms directly, levies require voter approval and are not guaranteed, and reserves are finite. The board's role is to weigh these trade-offs in consultation with the superintendent and community, guided by the district's educational priorities and legal obligations.

### The Budget Timeline

The annual budget cycle in Oregon follows a structured timeline. The superintendent and finance staff develop a proposed budget during the winter months. The budget committee convenes — typically beginning in January or February — to review projections, hear presentations, and discuss priorities. Public hearings are held to gather community input. The budget committee approves the budget, after which the board gives final adoption, typically in June before the July 1 start of the new fiscal year. For the 2026-27 budget, this process is already underway, and the $10.4 million deficit will be the defining issue at every stage.
