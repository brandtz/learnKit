## Overview

The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) is the state agency responsible for overseeing public K-12 education across Oregon's nearly 200 school districts, 20 education service districts (ESDs), and numerous charter and alternative schools. ODE serves as the administrative arm of the State Board of Education, translating statewide education policy into operational reality — managing billions in state and federal education funding, setting academic standards, administering assessments, ensuring compliance with state and federal law, and providing technical assistance to districts of all sizes. For a new school board member, understanding how ODE is organized, what it does, and how it interacts with your district is essential to effective governance.

ODE's work touches virtually every dimension of a district's operations. When your superintendent references "Division 22 compliance," that is an ODE-administered standard. When your business manager discusses the State School Fund allocation, that formula is calculated and distributed by ODE. When your special education director files an annual performance report, it goes to ODE. When the legislature passes a new graduation requirement, ODE writes the administrative rules and provides implementation guidance. In short, ODE is the connective tissue between the Oregon Legislature, the State Board of Education, and your local district.

This module provides an in-depth tour of ODE — its organizational structure, core functions, funding distribution mechanics, reporting and compliance frameworks, and the resources it makes available to board members. By the end, you should be able to identify the right ODE division for any question your district faces, understand the basics of the State School Fund formula, and know how to engage productively with ODE as a governance leader.

### Historical Context

Oregon's current education governance structure dates to a series of reforms in the 1990s and early 2000s. Prior to 1991, the elected Superintendent of Public Instruction led ODE. The legislature restructured the system through ORS 326.111 and subsequent statutes, establishing the Governor-appointed State Board of Education as the policymaking body and creating the position of Deputy Superintendent (later renamed Director of Education) to serve as the agency's chief executive. This shift was designed to depoliticize the state's education leadership and create a clearer separation between policy-setting (State Board) and policy implementation (ODE). Understanding this history helps explain why Oregon's structure differs from states that still elect their chief state school officer.

### ODE Organizational Structure

ODE is headquartered in Salem and employs approximately 600 staff organized across several major offices and divisions. At the top of the organizational chart:

- **Director of the Oregon Department of Education** — Appointed by the State Board of Education (with Governor input), the Director serves as the chief executive officer of the agency. The Director oversees all ODE operations, represents the agency to the legislature and the public, and advises the State Board on policy matters. The Director typically serves at the pleasure of the State Board, and the position has historically experienced turnover during gubernatorial transitions.

- **Deputy Director / Chief of Staff** — Supports the Director in day-to-day agency management and coordinates across divisions.

- **Chief Education Officer** — Oversees instructional programs, standards, and curriculum.

- **Chief Financial Officer** — Manages school finance, budget, and the State School Fund.

- **Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion** — Leads the agency's equity work, including the Oregon Equity Lens that is applied to policy development and resource allocation decisions.

#### Major ODE Divisions and Offices

| Division / Office | Primary Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Teaching, Learning & Assessment** | Academic standards (ELA, math, science, social studies), curriculum frameworks, instructional materials adoption, statewide assessments (OSAS), graduation requirements |
| **Student Services** | Special education (IDEA compliance), Section 504, English Language Learner programs, migrant education, McKinney-Vento (homeless students), foster care education |
| **School Finance & Operations** | State School Fund distribution, district budget review, transportation funding, facility standards, ADMw calculations, financial reporting |
| **Accountability & Improvement** | ESSA accountability framework, school and district report cards, school improvement grants, Comprehensive and Targeted Support designations |
| **Early Learning Division** | Pre-K programs, Oregon Pre-Kindergarten (OPK), Preschool Promise, early intervention/early childhood special education (EI/ECSE) |
| **Career & Technical Education (CTE)** | CTE program approval, Perkins V federal grants, career pathways, industry partnerships |
| **Office of Indian Education** | Tribal consultation, Native American student support, implementation of SB 13 (Tribal History/Shared History) |
| **Research & Data** | Statewide data collection, student information systems, research and evaluation, public data reporting |
| **Educator Advancement** | Educator workforce initiatives, mentoring and induction, National Board Certification support (Note: teacher licensure is handled by TSPC, not ODE) |

> 💡 **Tip:** Bookmark ODE's organizational chart on their website. When your district has a specific question — say, about a special education compliance issue or a CTE program approval — knowing which division handles it will save time and ensure you reach the right contact.

### State Board of Education vs. Local School Boards

One of the most important governance distinctions for new board members to understand is the difference between the State Board of Education and your local school board. Although they share the word "board," their authority, composition, and functions are fundamentally different.

**The State Board of Education:**

- Consists of **nine members** appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Oregon Senate (ORS 326.021)
- Includes one student member and one community college representative
- Members serve **four-year terms** and can be reappointed
- Sets **statewide education policy** by adopting Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs)
- Establishes graduation requirements, academic standards, and school performance expectations
- Appoints the Director of the Oregon Department of Education
- Does **not** manage individual districts or make local operational decisions
- Meets monthly, typically in Salem, with meetings open to the public

**Your Local School Board:**

- Consists of **five to seven members** elected by voters in the district (ORS 332.011)
- Governs a single school district within the framework established by state law and State Board policy
- Hires and evaluates the superintendent
- Adopts the district budget and sets the local tax rate
- Adopts local policies (which must comply with state law and OARs)
- Makes decisions about schools, programs, staffing levels, and capital projects
- Is accountable directly to the community through elections

**Key relationship points:**

- Local boards do **not** report to the State Board in a hierarchical sense. Oregon's governance system is decentralized — local boards have substantial autonomy within the guardrails of state law.
- The State Board sets the *minimum* standards (e.g., Division 22). Local boards may exceed those standards but cannot fall below them.
- When the State Board adopts a new rule — for example, changing graduation requirements — local boards must update their policies and practices to comply, but the *how* of implementation is largely a local decision.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** New board members sometimes assume ODE or the State Board can intervene directly in local disputes — for example, ordering a district to reverse a personnel decision. In reality, local boards have broad authority over local matters, and ODE's intervention powers are generally limited to situations involving legal non-compliance, civil rights violations, or financial distress. Most local governance decisions are resolved locally.

### ODE Core Functions in Detail

#### Standards and Curriculum

ODE develops and maintains Oregon's academic content standards — the learning expectations for each grade level and subject area. Current standards cover English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science (Next Generation Science Standards), Social Studies, Health Education, Physical Education, Arts, World Languages, and Computer Science. ODE also manages the **instructional materials adoption** process, in which committees of educators review and recommend textbooks and other materials that align with state standards.

For board members, the key takeaway is that your district's curriculum must align with state standards, but the specific curriculum materials and instructional approaches are chosen locally. When ODE adopts new standards (as it did with the updated social studies standards in 2024), districts typically have a multi-year implementation window.

#### Assessment and Accountability

ODE administers the **Oregon Statewide Assessment System (OSAS)**, which includes:

- **SBAC (Smarter Balanced)** — English Language Arts and Mathematics assessments in grades 3-8 and 11
- **OSAS Science** — Science assessments in grades 5, 8, and 11
- **English Language Proficiency Assessment (ELPA)** — Annual assessment for English learners
- **Extended Assessments** — Alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities
- **Kindergarten Assessment** — Early literacy and math readiness screener

Assessment results feed into Oregon's **accountability framework** under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Oregon's ESSA plan uses multiple indicators — academic achievement, growth, graduation rates, attendance, and English learner progress — to identify schools needing additional support. Schools are designated as:

- **Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI)** — The lowest-performing 5% of Title I schools and high schools with graduation rates below 67%
- **Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI)** — Schools with consistently underperforming student subgroups
- **Additional Targeted Support (ATSI)** — Schools with subgroups performing at the level of the lowest 5%

> 💡 **Tip:** As a board member, ask your superintendent to present the district's most recent school and district report cards (available on ODE's website). These reports show how your schools are performing on accountability indicators and whether any schools have been identified for improvement. This is a governance-level conversation, not a management-level one — focus on trends and whether the district has adequate plans in place.

#### School Finance

School finance is one of ODE's most critical functions and one that directly affects your district's budget. ODE calculates and distributes the **State School Fund (SSF)**, administers **Common School Fund** distributions, processes **federal grants** (Title I, Title II, Title III, Title IV, IDEA), and reviews district budgets for compliance with Oregon Local Budget Law.

ODE also provides technical assistance to district business managers, publishes guidance on financial reporting, and operates the **school finance toolkit** that districts use for revenue projections.

#### Special Education

ODE's Student Services division oversees special education compliance for all Oregon districts, ensuring adherence to the federal **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)** and corresponding state rules (OAR 581-015). ODE conducts monitoring reviews, provides dispute resolution services (mediation and due process hearings), reviews district performance on State Performance Plan indicators, and distributes IDEA Part B federal funds.

If your district receives a finding of non-compliance from ODE's special education monitoring, the district must correct the issue within one year. Board members should receive regular updates on special education compliance status.

#### Career and Technical Education (CTE)

ODE administers Oregon's CTE programs under the federal **Perkins V Act**, approving CTE programs of study, distributing Perkins funds, and setting quality standards. Oregon's CTE system includes career pathways in areas like health sciences, advanced manufacturing, information technology, agriculture, and business. Board members approving new CTE programs should be aware that ODE has specific approval requirements, including alignment with labor market needs and industry standards.

#### Equity and Indian Education

ODE's equity work is guided by the **Oregon Equity Lens**, a framework that requires the agency (and encourages districts) to consider how policies and decisions affect historically underserved communities. ODE also implements **Senate Bill 13** (2017), which requires instruction on the history, culture, and governments of Oregon's nine federally recognized tribes ("Tribal History/Shared History"). The Office of Indian Education provides curriculum resources and coordinates with tribal nations.

### How ODE Distributes Funding — The State School Fund

The **State School Fund (SSF)** is the largest single source of revenue for most Oregon school districts, typically accounting for 50-70% of a district's general fund budget. Understanding the SSF formula is fundamental to board-level financial oversight.

#### The ADMw Formula

SSF funding is distributed based on **ADMw — Average Daily Membership, weighted**. The formula works in three basic steps:

1. **Count enrollment (ADM):** ODE calculates each district's Average Daily Membership — the average number of students enrolled and in attendance across the school year.

2. **Apply weights:** Additional weights are added for students who require extra resources. These weights recognize that some students cost more to educate. Key weights include:

| Weight Category | Approximate Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Special Education** | 1.0 (doubles the student) | Students on IEPs receiving special education services |
| **English Language Learners** | 0.5 | Students identified as ELL |
| **Poverty (Free/Reduced Lunch)** | 0.25 | Students qualifying for free or reduced-price meals |
| **Neglected/Delinquent** | 0.25 | Students in neglected or delinquent facilities |
| **Foster Care** | 0.25 | Students in foster care |
| **Pregnant/Parenting** | 0.25 | Pregnant or parenting students |
| **Small School / Remote** | Varies | Additional weights for small and remote schools to ensure viability |
| **Transportation** | Varies | Based on approved transportation costs |

3. **Calculate district share:** Each district's ADMw is divided by the statewide total ADMw, and that percentage is applied to the total SSF appropriation to determine the district's allocation.

#### Simplified Example Calculation

Suppose the legislature appropriates **$10 billion** for the State School Fund in a biennium ($5 billion per year), and the statewide total ADMw is **700,000**.

**Per-ADMw funding = $5,000,000,000 ÷ 700,000 = approximately $7,143 per ADMw**

Now consider a hypothetical district:

| Factor | Count / Value |
|---|---|
| Base ADM (enrollment) | 10,000 students |
| Special Education students (×1.0 extra) | 1,400 → adds 1,400 ADMw |
| ELL students (×0.5 extra) | 800 → adds 400 ADMw |
| Poverty students (×0.25 extra) | 5,000 → adds 1,250 ADMw |
| Foster care students (×0.25 extra) | 100 → adds 25 ADMw |
| Transportation & small school weights | adds 200 ADMw |
| **Total ADMw** | **13,275** |

**District allocation = 13,275 × $7,143 ≈ $94.8 million per year from SSF**

Note that the district's base enrollment of 10,000 students generates an ADMw of 13,275 — a 32.75% increase — because of the weighted student populations. This is why enrollment counts, demographic data accuracy, and proper student identification (especially for special education, ELL, and poverty) are critical. Undercounting eligible students directly reduces your district's funding.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes assume the SSF formula is a simple per-pupil amount. It is not. Two districts with the same enrollment can receive vastly different per-pupil funding based on their student demographics. A district with high poverty, high ELL populations, and significant special education needs will have a higher ADMw per student — and therefore receive more SSF dollars per enrolled student. This is by design: the formula directs resources toward greater need.

> 💡 **Tip:** Ask your business manager to walk you through the district's ADMw calculation each year. Understand which weight categories drive the most additional funding and whether the district is accurately identifying and reporting all eligible students. Even small improvements in data accuracy can translate to significant revenue.

#### Other Funding Streams Through ODE

Beyond the SSF, ODE distributes several other funding streams:

- **Common School Fund** — Income from state-owned lands, distributed to districts on a per-student basis
- **Title I (ESEA)** — Federal funds for schools with high percentages of low-income students
- **Title II** — Federal funds for educator professional development
- **Title III** — Federal funds for English learner programs
- **Title IV** — Federal funds for student support and academic enrichment
- **IDEA Part B** — Federal special education funds
- **Perkins V** — Federal CTE funds
- **High Cost Disability Fund** — State funds to help districts cover exceptionally high-cost special education placements
- **Student Investment Account (SIA)** — Established by the Student Success Act (2019), providing targeted funds for meeting students' mental and behavioral health needs, increasing academic achievement for historically underserved students, and reducing academic disparities

### ODE Reporting Requirements for Districts

Oregon school districts are required to submit a substantial volume of data and reports to ODE throughout the year. These reports serve multiple purposes: funding calculations, accountability, compliance monitoring, and public transparency. Key reporting areas include:

| Report / Data Collection | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Fall Membership (ADM)** | October | Enrollment count used for SSF calculations |
| **Cumulative ADM** | Quarterly | Ongoing enrollment tracking |
| **Student demographics** | Ongoing | Race/ethnicity, gender, program participation |
| **Attendance data** | Ongoing / Annual | Regular and chronic absenteeism rates |
| **Assessment results** | Spring (testing), Summer (results) | Statewide assessment data |
| **Graduation and dropout data** | Annual | Four-year, five-year, and completer rates |
| **Special education child count** | December 1 | Federal IDEA reporting |
| **Special education performance** | Annual | State Performance Plan indicators |
| **Financial data (AFR)** | November | Annual Financial Report to ODE |
| **Budget submission** | July | Adopted budget filing |
| **Civil rights data (CRDC)** | Biennial | Federal Office for Civil Rights collection |
| **CTE enrollment and outcomes** | Annual | Perkins V accountability |
| **Restraint and seclusion** | Annual | ORS 339.300 compliance |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes view ODE reporting as purely an administrative task that doesn't require board attention. In reality, data quality directly affects funding (ADMw calculations depend on accurate enrollment and demographic data) and accountability ratings (assessment participation rates affect school designations). Board members should ensure the district invests adequate resources in data systems and staff training to maintain reporting accuracy.

---

### ODE Compliance and Oversight

ODE's compliance and oversight role operates on a continuum — from routine monitoring to formal intervention. Here is how the escalation typically works:

1. **Routine Monitoring:** ODE reviews district data submissions, conducts desk audits of special education files, and monitors compliance with Division 22 standards. Most districts operate in this zone year to year.

2. **Technical Assistance:** When ODE identifies potential compliance concerns, it typically starts with technical assistance — phone calls, guidance documents, on-site visits — to help the district address the issue voluntarily.

3. **Corrective Action Plans:** If a compliance issue is confirmed and not resolved through technical assistance, ODE may require a formal corrective action plan with specific steps and timelines. This is common in special education monitoring.

4. **Formal Findings / Sanctions:** For persistent or serious non-compliance, ODE can issue formal findings. Under ORS 327.103 and related statutes, ODE has authority to:
   - Withhold state funding
   - Require district corrective action
   - Assign a state monitor or fiscal agent
   - In extreme cases, recommend district dissolution or boundary changes

5. **Federal Compliance:** For federal programs (Title I, IDEA, etc.), ODE acts as the pass-through agency and can impose federal sanctions — including fund recovery — if a district fails to comply with federal requirements.

> 💡 **Tip:** The best way to avoid compliance problems is prevention. Encourage your superintendent to maintain a compliance calendar, assign clear staff responsibility for each reporting and compliance area, and bring any ODE findings or communications to the board's attention promptly. A compliance issue that festers becomes a governance crisis.

---

### School Improvement and ESSA Accountability

Oregon's accountability system under the **Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)** uses a multiple-measures approach. The state's ESSA plan (approved by the U.S. Department of Education) includes:

- **Academic Achievement** — Proficiency rates on SBAC ELA and Math
- **Academic Growth** — Student growth percentiles
- **Graduation Rate** — Four-year and five-year adjusted cohort rates
- **Regular Attendance** — Percentage of students who are not chronically absent (missing fewer than 10% of school days)
- **English Learner Progress** — Progress toward English proficiency
- **Ninth-Grade On-Track** — Percentage of ninth graders on track to graduate

Schools identified as CSI or TSI must develop improvement plans with stakeholder input, and ODE provides grants and technical assistance to support implementation. For CSI schools, the district must partner with ODE to develop a rigorous improvement plan, and the school must demonstrate improvement within a specific timeframe or face more intensive intervention.

Board members should understand that ESSA accountability is a **federal requirement** administered by ODE. If your district has schools identified for improvement, this should be a standing board agenda item with regular progress reports.

---

### How Board Members Interact with ODE

As a local board member, you will interact with ODE in several ways:

- **Conferences and Convenings:** ODE hosts or co-hosts events throughout the year, including the Oregon Education Investment Board meetings, superintendent conferences, and topic-specific convenings. Board members are welcome at most public events.

- **Technical Assistance:** When your district has a question about a state rule, funding formula, or compliance requirement, ODE staff are available for phone and email consultations. Your superintendent or business manager will typically be the primary point of contact, but board members can also reach out.

- **Board Member-Specific Resources:** ODE's website includes resources specifically designed for board members, including guides on school finance, accountability, and governance.

- **Complaint Processes:** Community members may file complaints with ODE if they believe a district is violating state law or federal requirements (e.g., special education, civil rights). ODE investigates and can require corrective action. Board members should be aware this process exists and ensure the district has clear internal complaint procedures to resolve issues before they escalate to ODE.

- **Legislative Engagement:** ODE provides testimony and analysis during legislative sessions. Board members can attend legislative hearings, track ODE's legislative concepts, and provide testimony on education bills.

- **ODE Email Updates:** Sign up for ODE's email newsletters, which provide updates on rule changes, funding announcements, and upcoming events.

> 💡 **Tip:** Establish a professional relationship with your ODE regional contact early in your board tenure. ODE staff can be valuable partners when your district is navigating complex issues. A call to the right ODE division before a problem escalates can save significant time and stress.

---

### ODE vs. TSPC — Understanding the Distinction

New board members sometimes confuse ODE with the **Teacher Standards and Practices Commission (TSPC)**. They are separate entities:

| | ODE | TSPC |
|---|---|---|
| **Governed by** | State Board of Education | TSPC Commission (Governor-appointed) |
| **Primary role** | Statewide education policy implementation, funding, accountability | Educator licensure, professional standards, ethics enforcement |
| **Key functions** | Standards, assessment, school finance, compliance | Issuing teaching licenses, investigating ethical violations, revoking/suspending licenses |
| **Relevant statutes** | ORS 326, 327, 329, 336, 339, 343 | ORS 342 |
| **Board interaction** | Frequent (funding, compliance, reporting) | Occasional (when educator conduct issues arise) |

TSPC handles teacher licensing, ethical standards, and misconduct investigations. If your district has a teacher facing licensure action or an ethical complaint, TSPC is the relevant body — not ODE. However, ODE and TSPC coordinate on educator workforce issues, and both agencies fall within the broader education governance ecosystem.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Assuming ODE handles teacher licensing or misconduct. If a community member contacts you about a teacher's license or ethical conduct, direct them to TSPC (tspc.oregon.gov), not ODE.

---

### Recent ODE Priorities (2024-2026)

ODE's strategic priorities shift with each Director and State Board cycle, but the following themes have dominated the agency's work in the 2024-2026 period:

- **Graduation Rate Improvement:** Oregon has historically lagged the national average in on-time graduation rates. ODE has focused on ninth-grade on-track indicators, credit recovery programs, and dropout re-engagement strategies. The Graduation Improvement Initiative provides targeted grants and technical assistance to districts with the lowest rates.

- **Equity Lens and Culturally Responsive Education:** ODE continues to apply its Equity Lens to all policy and funding decisions. Recent work includes expanding culturally responsive curriculum resources, supporting the implementation of SB 13 (Tribal History/Shared History), and publishing disaggregated data to highlight achievement gaps.

- **Mental Health and Behavioral Support:** Following the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on student well-being, ODE has prioritized mental health support. The Student Investment Account (SIA) has directed significant resources toward school counselors, mental health professionals, and trauma-informed practices. ODE has also published guidance on threat assessment, suicide prevention, and multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS).

- **Chronic Absenteeism Reduction:** Oregon's chronic absenteeism rates spiked during and after the pandemic. ODE launched statewide initiatives focused on attendance, including best practice toolkits, attendance mentor programs, and community partnership frameworks.

- **Student Success Act Implementation:** The Student Success Act (HB 3427, 2019) created the Student Investment Account and the High School Success program. ODE continues to oversee the distribution and accountability for these funds, requiring districts to submit integrated plans focused on equity, mental health, and reducing disparities.

- **Educator Workforce Pipeline:** Addressing teacher shortages, particularly in rural areas and high-need subject areas like special education, STEM, and bilingual education. ODE has supported grow-your-own programs, alternative licensure pathways, and partnerships with universities.

### Summary: Your Relationship with ODE

As a local board member, think of ODE as operating on three levels in relation to your district:

1. **Regulator** — ODE sets and enforces the rules your district must follow (Division 22, special education compliance, financial reporting). This is the compliance dimension.

2. **Funder** — ODE calculates and distributes the State School Fund and federal pass-through dollars that make up the majority of your district's revenue. This is the financial dimension.

3. **Partner** — ODE provides technical assistance, training, data, and resources that help your district improve. This is the support dimension.

Effective board members understand all three dimensions and engage with ODE accordingly. You comply with reporting requirements and rules, you monitor funding formulas and advocate for adequate state funding, and you take advantage of ODE's resources and expertise to strengthen your district's programs. ODE is not an adversary — it is a critical partner in the shared mission of educating Oregon's students.
