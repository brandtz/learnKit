## Overview

Oregon's Public Meetings Law and Government Ethics statutes form the legal backbone of transparent governance for every public body in the state — including school boards. As a board member of Springfield Public Schools, nearly every action you take in your official capacity is governed by these laws. Violations can void board decisions, expose you personally to penalties, and erode public trust that takes years to rebuild.

This module provides a comprehensive, practical guide to Oregon's Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610–192.690), the closely related Public Records Law (ORS 192.311–192.478), and the Oregon Government Ethics Law (ORS Chapter 244). You'll learn not only what the law says, but how it plays out in real boardroom scenarios, where the common traps are, and how to build habits that keep you and the board in compliance.

### Why These Laws Matter for Board Members

Oregon has some of the strongest open-government laws in the nation. The legislature has declared that "the Oregon form of government requires an informed public aware of the deliberations and decisions of governing bodies and the information upon which such decisions were made" (ORS 192.610). That's not aspirational language — it's a mandate.

For school board members, the stakes are especially high:

- **Public trust**: Parents, staff, and taxpayers expect transparency about how their schools are governed.
- **Legal exposure**: Any person can challenge a board action taken in violation of public meeting law.
- **Decision validity**: Actions taken in improper meetings can be voided entirely.
- **Personal liability**: Ethics violations carry financial penalties that come out of your own pocket.

## Oregon Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610–192.690)

### What Constitutes a "Meeting"

The definition of "meeting" under Oregon law is broader than most new board members expect. Under ORS 192.610(5), a **meeting** is:

> "The convening of a governing body of a public body for which a quorum is required in order to make a decision or to deliberate toward a decision on any matter."

There are three critical elements:

1. **A governing body** — the school board qualifies.
2. **A quorum** — for a seven-member board like Springfield's, four members constitute a quorum.
3. **Deliberation toward a decision** — this is the trigger most often misunderstood.

**Deliberation** does not require a vote. It does not even require that members express opinions. The Attorney General has interpreted "deliberation" to include any discussion among a quorum of members where information is gathered, shared, or exchanged on matters that could reasonably come before the board for a decision.

| Scenario | Meeting? | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Four board members discuss the budget at a restaurant | **Yes** | Quorum + deliberation on board business |
| Three board members chat about a football game at a grocery store | **No** | No quorum, not board business |
| Four members attend a conference and sit together at lunch | **Maybe** | Only if they discuss board business |
| Board chair emails all members asking for feedback on a policy draft | **Yes** | Serial meeting (see below) |
| A board work session with no votes planned | **Yes** | Deliberation toward future decisions |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Many new board members believe a "meeting" only occurs when votes are taken. Under Oregon law, any gathering of a quorum where board business is discussed — even informally, even socially — triggers the Public Meetings Law. The standard is *deliberation*, not *decision*.

> 💡 **Tip**: When you find yourself at a social event with other board members, mentally count heads. If a quorum is present, steer conversation away from any topic that could come before the board. A good rule of thumb: if it might appear on a future agenda, don't discuss it.

### Notice Requirements

Oregon law requires that the public receive adequate notice before any meeting of a governing body. The specific requirements differ based on the type of meeting.

#### Regular Meetings (ORS 192.640(1))

For regularly scheduled meetings (such as Springfield's twice-monthly board meetings), the board must give public notice that reasonably informs the public of the time and place of the meeting. This means:

- Posting an annual schedule of regular meetings at the beginning of each year
- Including the schedule on the district website
- Posting at the principal office of the district (typically the district administration building)
- Listing the time, place, and date of each meeting

#### Special Meetings (ORS 192.640(2))

When the board calls a meeting outside its regular schedule, stricter notice requirements apply:

- **At least 24 hours' notice** must be given to members of the board, the media that have requested notice, and the general public
- Notice must state the **time, place, and specific agenda topics**
- Only topics listed in the notice may be discussed — you cannot add items at a special meeting
- Notice must be "reasonably calculated to give actual notice to interested persons"

#### Emergency Meetings (ORS 192.640(3))

In a genuine emergency (an actual emergency threatening life, health, or property), the 24-hour notice requirement may be waived. However:

- The board must make a good-faith effort to provide notice
- The minutes must describe the emergency justifying the shortened notice
- This exception is very narrow — budget deadlines or political urgency do not qualify

| Meeting Type | Notice Period | Agenda Flexibility | Posting Requirements |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Regular | Reasonable (annual schedule) | Full flexibility | District office, website |
| Special | 24 hours minimum | Only noticed topics | Same + media notification |
| Emergency | Best effort | Only emergency items | Document emergency in minutes |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Boards sometimes call "special meetings" with less than 24 hours' notice for matters that are urgent but not true emergencies. A contract deadline next week or a media controversy does not constitute an emergency under ORS 192.640(3). Plan ahead and use special meetings with proper notice.

> 💡 **Tip**: Springfield's board secretary maintains a media notification list. If you become aware that a special meeting may be needed, alert the superintendent's office immediately so the 24-hour clock can start as early as possible.

### Executive Sessions — ORS 192.660

Executive sessions are closed meetings where the public is excluded. Oregon law treats them as **exceptions** to the general rule of openness, and they are strictly limited to specific purposes enumerated in ORS 192.660(2).

#### Procedure for Entering Executive Session

The procedure for entering an executive session is not optional — it is required by statute:

1. **Cite the specific statutory authority** — the board chair must state the specific subsection of ORS 192.660(2) that authorizes the session (e.g., "We are entering executive session pursuant to ORS 192.660(2)(d) to conduct deliberations with persons designated to carry on labor negotiations").
2. **Announce the purpose** — a general description of what will be discussed.
3. **Instruct media** — under ORS 192.660(4), credentialed media representatives may attend executive sessions (with limited exceptions), but must be informed they cannot report on subjects that are not listed in ORS 192.660(2).
4. **Exclude the public** — all non-authorized persons must leave.
5. **No final decisions** — the board **cannot take final action** (vote) in executive session. Decisions must be made in open session.

#### Exiting Executive Session

When the executive session concludes:

1. Reconvene in open session.
2. The chair may state that the executive session has concluded (specific topics need not be disclosed).
3. If a decision was reached during executive session deliberation, the actual vote must occur in the open session that follows.

#### Complete Table of Executive Session Purposes — ORS 192.660(2)

| Subsection | Purpose | Common Board Use |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **(a)** | Employment of public officers, employees, and agents — initial employment | Superintendent hiring |
| **(b)** | Dismissal or discipline of an officer, employee, or agent (unless they request open hearing) | Personnel discipline discussions |
| **(c)** | Deliberations with persons designated to negotiate real property transactions | Acquiring or selling district property |
| **(d)** | Deliberations with persons designated to conduct labor negotiations | Teacher/staff union contract negotiations |
| **(e)** | Deliberations on matters related to litigation or litigation likely to be filed (in conjunction with legal counsel) | Pending lawsuits, legal claims |
| **(f)** | Consideration of exempt public records (ORS 192.355–192.385) | Reviewing confidential student records, personnel files |
| **(g)** | Trade negotiations (primarily applies to other public bodies) | Rare for school boards |
| **(h)** | Consideration of preliminary negotiations on matters of trade or commerce where the body is competing with other entities | Rare for school boards |
| **(i)** | Performance evaluations of public officers and employees (unless they request open session) | **Superintendent evaluation** — one of the most common uses |
| **(j)** | Deliberations on information related to security of public buildings, infrastructure | School safety planning, threat assessment protocols |
| **(k)** | Labor negotiator consultations | Pre-bargaining strategy sessions |
| **(l)** | Negotiations regarding the use of a public body's real property when public disclosure would adversely affect bargaining position | Lease negotiations for district property |
| **(m)** | Discussions related to school safety or security plans or the training or deployment of school safety personnel | Detailed safety/security planning |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Boards sometimes enter executive session for "personnel matters" without specifying which subsection applies. "Personnel" could fall under (a) for hiring, (b) for discipline, or (i) for evaluation. You must cite the correct, specific subsection. Citing the wrong one — or none at all — can invalidate the session.

> 💡 **Tip**: Before any executive session, the board chair should have the exact statutory citation written down and ready to read aloud. The superintendent and board attorney should confirm the citation before the meeting. Keep a laminated reference card of ORS 192.660(2) subsections at the dais.

#### What Cannot Happen in Executive Session

- **No final votes or decisions** — deliberation is permitted, but the vote must happen in open session
- **No topics beyond the cited purpose** — if you enter executive session to discuss labor negotiations under (d), you cannot pivot to discussing a superintendent evaluation under (i) without returning to open session and re-entering under the new authority
- **No retaliation or discipline of media** — credentialed media have a statutory right to attend most executive sessions under ORS 192.660(4)
- **No circumvention** — you cannot use executive session to have conversations the law requires to be public

### The Serial Meeting Problem

One of the most frequently violated provisions of Oregon's Public Meetings Law involves **serial communications** — sometimes called "daisy-chain" or "hub-and-spoke" meetings. These occur when a quorum of board members deliberate on board business through a sequence of one-on-one or small-group conversations rather than in a noticed public meeting.

#### How Serial Meetings Happen

**The Phone Tree**: The board chair calls Member A to discuss a superintendent contract issue. Then calls Member B with the same topic and relays Member A's views. Then calls Member C. By the time the chair has spoken with three other members, a quorum has been involved in deliberation — without any public meeting.

**The Email Chain**: A board member sends an email to two colleagues about an upcoming policy decision. One of those members forwards it to another with comments. The reply-all chain now involves a quorum, and the email trail constitutes deliberation.

**The Text Thread**: A group text among four or more board members discussing any matter of board business is a meeting — even though it happens on personal phones at 10 PM on a Saturday.

**The "Hub-and-Spoke" Model**: The superintendent or board chair acts as the "hub," talking individually with each board member about a pending decision, collecting their views, and conveying the consensus back. Even if no two board members speak directly, the facilitator has enabled deliberation among a quorum.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members often believe that as long as they communicate one-on-one, they're not violating the law. But the Oregon Attorney General has made clear that a series of one-on-one communications that collectively involve a quorum and address board business can constitute an illegal serial meeting, regardless of the medium used.

> 💡 **Tip**: It is perfectly fine to send one-way informational communications to all board members — for example, the superintendent distributing a report or data. The violation occurs when the communication becomes **interactive** — when members begin responding, sharing opinions, or building toward a collective position. Keep informational emails strictly one-way, and add a note: "This is informational only. Please save any discussion for our next board meeting."

#### Safe Communication Practices

| Communication | Safe? | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Superintendent sends budget report to all members | ✅ Yes | One-way informational |
| Board member emails all members: "Here's an article I found interesting" | ✅ Usually | Risky if it solicits responses on board business |
| Board chair calls each member to discuss how they want to vote | ❌ No | Serial meeting |
| Group text among 4+ members about a policy | ❌ No | Constitutes a meeting |
| Two board members meet for coffee and discuss the budget | ✅ Yes | Below quorum |
| Superintendent relays each member's position to others | ❌ No | Hub-and-spoke serial meeting |

## Public Records Law Basics (ORS 192.311–192.478)

Oregon's Public Records Law works hand-in-hand with the Public Meetings Law. Together, they ensure that the public can both observe government deliberation and access the documents underlying those deliberations.

### What Is a Public Record?

Under ORS 192.311(5), a **public record** includes:

> "Any writing that contains information relating to the conduct of the public's business... regardless of physical form or characteristics."

This definition is extremely broad. It includes:

- Paper documents, memos, and letters
- Emails sent or received on government or personal accounts if they relate to board business
- Text messages about board business — even on personal phones
- Social media posts and direct messages related to official duties
- Voicemails, recordings, and videos
- Spreadsheets, databases, and digital files
- Notes written during meetings

#### Personal Devices and Accounts

A critical point for board members: **using your personal email, phone, or social media account does not make a communication private if it relates to board business.** If you text a fellow board member about the upcoming budget vote from your personal phone, that text message is a public record subject to disclosure under a public records request.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members frequently use personal email or text messages to discuss board business, believing these are private. They are not. Under Oregon law, the content determines whether something is a public record, not the device or account used to create it.

> 💡 **Tip**: Use your district-issued email for all board business. If you must use a personal device, forward any board-related communications to your district email so they are captured in the district's records retention system. Better yet, adopt a simple rule: if it's about board business, it goes through official channels.

### Records Retention

Oregon law and the Secretary of State's Archives Division set retention schedules for public records. School districts must follow ORS 192.105 and applicable retention schedules. Key points:

- **Board meeting minutes** must be retained permanently
- **Executive session notes** (if any are taken) must be retained per schedule
- **Email correspondence** related to board business typically has a minimum retention period (often 2–5 years depending on the category)
- **Destroying records** before the retention period expires is illegal under ORS 162.305 (official misconduct) and can carry criminal penalties

### Responding to Public Records Requests

When someone submits a public records request to the district:

1. The district must acknowledge the request within **five business days** (ORS 192.329)
2. The district must complete the request within a **reasonable time** — and must provide an estimated completion date if it will take longer than 10 business days
3. The district may charge reasonable fees for search time and copying
4. Certain records are **exempt** from disclosure under ORS 192.345 and 192.355 (e.g., student records protected by FERPA, certain personnel records, attorney-client privileged communications)

> 💡 **Tip**: If you receive a public records request directly (at a board meeting, via personal email, or even verbally), forward it to the superintendent's office immediately. Do not attempt to fulfill or deny it yourself. The district has trained staff and legal counsel who handle these requests.

## Remedies and Enforcement

### Who Can Challenge a Violation?

Oregon's Public Meetings Law is enforced through several channels:

- **Any person** may file a complaint with the governing body itself (ORS 192.680(1))
- **Any person** may file a lawsuit in circuit court within 60 days of the alleged violation (ORS 192.680(2))
- The **Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC)** investigates ethics complaints
- The **Attorney General** can investigate and take action regarding public meeting violations
- **District attorneys** can investigate potential criminal violations

### Consequences of Violations

| Violation Type | Consequence |
|---------------|-------------|
| Decision made in an improper meeting | May be **voided** by a court (ORS 192.680(3)) |
| Failure to give proper notice | Decision may be voided; injunction possible |
| Improper executive session | Decision voided; potential personal liability |
| Willful violation of public meetings law | Up to **$1,000 personal fine** per violation (ORS 192.685) |
| Ethics violation | Fines up to **$5,000** per violation (ORS 244.350(4)) |
| Destruction of public records | Criminal charges possible under ORS 162.305 |

### Real Oregon Cases

**Malheur County (2019)**: County commissioners were found to have conducted serial meetings via phone calls to discuss budget matters. The Oregon DOJ concluded that the phone conversations constituted deliberation among a quorum outside a noticed public meeting. The affected budget decisions were challenged and the county had to redo them in proper public meetings.

**Portland Public Schools (2014)**: PPS board members exchanged emails that built toward a consensus on a superintendent contract. Media outlets obtained the emails through public records requests. Though no formal enforcement action was taken, the revelation severely damaged public trust and led to significant media criticism. The incident is frequently cited in OSBA training as a cautionary tale about serial meetings.

**City of Tigard (2008)**: The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that city council members had violated the Public Meetings Law by conducting a "walking quorum" — discussing agenda items in small groups that collectively constituted a quorum before the public meeting. The court emphasized that the law focuses on the **substance** of communications, not their form.

**Lebanon School District (2017)**: A board member was found to have used a personal email account to discuss pending board decisions with multiple other members. When a public records request was filed, the member initially claimed the emails were "personal." An investigation determined they constituted public records, and the district was ordered to produce them.

> 💡 **Tip**: These cases illustrate that violations are often unintentional. Board members don't usually set out to break the law — they fall into traps of convenience. The best protection is understanding the rules and building good habits from day one.

## Oregon Government Ethics (ORS Chapter 244)

This module builds on the foundational ethics content from Tier 1 (T1-M05) by examining the **statutory framework** of Oregon Government Ethics in greater depth.

### The Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC)

The OGEC is the state agency responsible for administering and enforcing Oregon's ethics laws. Key points:

- OGEC investigates complaints against public officials, including school board members
- OGEC provides advisory opinions that clarify how the law applies to specific situations
- OGEC conducts training (which board members are required to complete)
- OGEC publishes a guide for public officials that every board member should read

### Key Ethics Provisions for Board Members

#### Conflicts of Interest (ORS 244.020(1), 244.120)

An **actual conflict of interest** exists when a board action would result in a private financial benefit or detriment to you, a relative, or a business with which you're associated. A **potential conflict** exists when the action *could reasonably* result in such a benefit or detriment.

**Required actions:**

- **Actual conflict**: You must publicly announce the conflict and **refrain from participating** in discussion and voting (ORS 244.120(2))
- **Potential conflict**: You must publicly announce the conflict but **may participate** in the discussion and vote (ORS 244.120(1))

| Type | Must Announce? | May Discuss? | May Vote? |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Actual conflict | Yes | No | No |
| Potential conflict | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| No conflict | N/A | Yes | Yes |

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members sometimes fail to distinguish between actual and potential conflicts. The key question is whether the financial impact is certain (actual) or merely possible (potential). When in doubt, announce it as a potential conflict and consult OGEC's advisory opinion process before the meeting if time permits.

#### Use of Position (ORS 244.040(1))

A public official must not use their position to obtain financial gain or avoid financial detriment, other than official compensation, for themselves, relatives, or businesses with which they're associated. This provision covers:

- Using your board title to gain preferential treatment in a personal business deal
- Directing district contracts to a business you own or in which a family member has an interest
- Using confidential information gained through your board position for personal benefit

#### Gifts (ORS 244.025)

Oregon has strict gift limits for public officials:

- You may not receive gifts with an aggregate value exceeding **$50 from a single source** in a calendar year if the source has a legislative or administrative interest in your decisions
- Certain items are **not considered gifts**: published materials, food/beverage for immediate consumption at a reception, informational materials related to your duties
- Campaign contributions are governed separately under Oregon election law and are not subject to the $50 gift limit

> 💡 **Tip**: Vendors, contractors, and organizations that do business with the district are considered sources with a "legislative or administrative interest." If a textbook company sends you a $75 gift basket during the holidays, you must decline or return it. When in doubt, check with the superintendent's office or OGEC.

#### Annual Ethics Training Requirement

Under ORS 244.320, board members must complete ethics training. The OGEC provides online training modules. Best practice for Springfield:

- Complete OGEC training within 30 days of taking office
- Complete refresher training annually
- Document completion and keep certificates on file with the board secretary

---

## How Technology Affects Compliance

Modern technology creates new compliance challenges that Oregon's Public Meetings Law — written decades ago — didn't anticipate. However, the principles remain the same.

### Virtual and Hybrid Meetings

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many public bodies have continued offering virtual or hybrid meeting options. Key considerations:

- **ORS 192.670** allows governing bodies to meet by "teleconference" or "electronic communication" as long as the public has access to the meeting
- The public must be able to listen to (and ideally watch) the proceedings in real time
- If members attend virtually, they still count toward quorum
- Voting must be conducted in a manner where each member's vote is recorded — roll call votes are standard for virtual meetings
- The meeting location must still be noticed, and a physical location should be provided where the public can attend

#### Best Practices for Virtual Meetings

- Use the district's official platform (typically Zoom or Teams with a public access link)
- Post the access link in the meeting notice
- Ensure the recording is preserved as a public record
- Have a backup plan if technology fails — recess rather than continue without public access

### Social Media

Board members' use of social media raises significant public meetings and records concerns:

- A Facebook comment thread among a quorum of board members about district business is a potential serial meeting
- Direct messages about board business are public records
- Even "liking" or reacting to posts about pending board decisions could be seen as expressing a position outside a public meeting

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Board members sometimes create private Facebook groups or group chats "just for the board" to share information. If four or more members are in the group and board business is discussed, this is a public meeting violation. If the group stores messages, those are public records.

> 💡 **Tip**: If you use social media in your capacity as a board member, keep it one-way: share information and refer people to board meetings for discussion. Never engage in back-and-forth with other board members about board business on social media platforms.

### Electronic Voting

Oregon law requires that votes be recorded and that the public know how each member voted. If your board uses any form of electronic voting:

- Each member's vote must be individually recorded in the minutes
- The technology must be reliable enough that disputes about vote tallies don't arise
- In practice, most school boards in Oregon continue to use roll call or voice votes even in virtual settings

---

## Interaction Between Public Meeting Law and Board Policy

Springfield Public Schools maintains board policies that supplement state law. Key policies related to this module include:

- **Board meeting procedures** — these policies codify how the board conducts regular, special, and emergency meetings, consistent with ORS requirements
- **Executive session policy** — outlines procedures specific to Springfield for entering and exiting executive session
- **Communication policy** — establishes expectations for board member communications, including email and social media use
- **Public comment policy** — while Oregon law does not require boards to allow public comment (it only requires public access), Springfield has chosen to provide public comment opportunities as a matter of policy and good governance
- **Records retention policy** — aligns with state retention schedules and OAR requirements

> 💡 **Tip**: Board policy is often more restrictive than state law. For example, even if the law allows something, board policy may prohibit it. Always check both. OSBA provides policy templates that Springfield has adopted and adapted. Familiarize yourself with the BDBC (Board Meeting Procedures) and BHB (Board Member Ethics) policy series.

## Compliance Best Practices

### Annual Compliance Checklist

At the beginning of each year, the board should:

- [ ] Adopt and publicly post the annual meeting schedule (ORS 192.640(1))
- [ ] Verify the media notification list is current for special meeting notices
- [ ] Confirm all board members have completed OGEC ethics training
- [ ] Review the district's records retention schedule
- [ ] Distribute updated ORS 192.660(2) executive session reference cards
- [ ] Review the board communication policy with all members
- [ ] Confirm the district website lists all meeting dates, times, locations, and access information

### Before Every Meeting

- [ ] Verify notice was properly posted (especially for special meetings)
- [ ] Prepare the specific statutory citation for any planned executive session
- [ ] Confirm that the meeting room is accessible to the public and ADA-compliant
- [ ] Test any virtual meeting technology before the meeting begins
- [ ] Ensure the recording system is functioning
- [ ] Review the agenda for any items that might trigger a conflict of interest

### Communication Ground Rules

1. **Never reply-all** to board-wide emails with substantive comments about board business
2. **Never forward** one board member's opinions to another on pending decisions
3. **Use district email** for all official board communications
4. **Save all records** — do not delete emails, texts, or voicemails related to board business until the retention period expires
5. **When in doubt, don't** — if you're unsure whether a communication crosses the line, save it for the next board meeting

> 💡 **Tip**: Some boards adopt a "sunshine rule" — a self-imposed standard that goes beyond legal minimums. Consider treating all board communications as if they'll be on the front page of the Register-Guard tomorrow. If you'd be comfortable with that, proceed. If not, reconsider.

## Summary

Oregon's transparency laws exist because democracy works best in the open. As a Springfield Public Schools board member, your commitment to these laws isn't just about avoiding penalties — it's about honoring the trust the community has placed in you.

**Key takeaways:**

- A "meeting" occurs whenever a quorum deliberates toward a decision — regardless of location, format, or formality
- Notice requirements vary by meeting type but must always be followed
- Executive sessions are exceptions, not defaults — cite the specific ORS subsection, keep to the stated purpose, and vote in open session
- Serial meetings through any communication medium violate the law
- All communications about board business are public records, regardless of the device or account used
- Ethics violations carry real financial penalties — understand conflicts of interest, gift rules, and use-of-position restrictions
- Technology creates new risks but doesn't change the underlying legal principles
- When in doubt, err on the side of transparency — it's what Oregon law demands and what your community deserves
