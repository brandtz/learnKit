## Overview

Board policy is the primary tool through which a school board exercises its governance authority. Policies are the formal, written statements that express the board's expectations, values, and directives on everything from curriculum standards and student discipline to financial management and employee conduct. They are the bridge between the board's vision and the district's daily operations — and understanding how policy works is fundamental to effective board service.

Policy is how a board leaves its mark on the district in a lasting, structural way. Individual board members come and go; superintendents change; budgets rise and fall. But the policy manual endures. A well-constructed policy framework gives the district consistency, legal protection, and clarity of purpose. A neglected or poorly designed policy manual creates confusion, liability, and governance dysfunction.

This module explains the hierarchy of authority within which policy operates, the OSBA policy framework used by most Oregon districts, the process for adopting and revising policies, the critical distinction between policy and administrative regulation, and the common pitfalls that trip up new board members when it comes to policy governance.

### The Policy Hierarchy: From Federal Law to Building Procedure

Board policy does not exist in a vacuum. It sits within a hierarchy of authority that every board member must understand:

| Level | Source | Examples | Who Creates It |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **1. Federal Law & Constitution** | U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, federal regulations | IDEA (special education), Title IX (gender equity), FERPA (student records), First Amendment | Congress, federal agencies |
| **2. State Law & Constitution** | Oregon Constitution, ORS (Oregon Revised Statutes), OAR (Oregon Administrative Rules) | ORS 332 (school boards), ORS 339 (student discipline), ORS 342 (teachers), ORS 327 (school finance) | Oregon Legislature, state agencies (ODE) |
| **3. Board Policy** | Formal statements adopted by the board through vote | Graduation requirements, student conduct expectations, hiring procedures, budget priorities | School board (formal vote in public meeting) |
| **4. Administrative Regulation** | Detailed procedures implementing board policy | Step-by-step enrollment procedures, specific discipline consequences, purchasing protocols | Superintendent and administrative staff |
| **5. Building/Department Procedures** | Local practices within schools or departments | Classroom rules, office procedures, bell schedules | Principals, department heads, individual staff |

**The critical principle:** Each level must be consistent with the levels above it. Board policy cannot contradict state or federal law. Administrative regulations cannot contradict board policy. Building procedures cannot contradict administrative regulations.

When a conflict exists between levels, the higher authority prevails. If a board policy requires something that state law prohibits, the state law controls and the policy must be revised. If an administrative regulation conflicts with board policy, the policy governs.

> **💡 Tip:** When debating a policy change, always ask: *"Is this consistent with state and federal law?"* and *"Does this conflict with any existing board policy?"* If you are unsure, ask the superintendent to have legal counsel review the proposed language before adoption.

### The OSBA Policy Framework

The Oregon School Boards Association (OSBA) operates one of the most comprehensive model policy services in the nation. Most Oregon school districts build their policy manuals on the OSBA framework, which provides:

- **Model policies** drafted by legal experts and updated regularly to reflect changes in Oregon and federal law
- **A standardized coding system** that organizes policies by topic area
- **Legal references** linking each policy to the relevant statutes and regulations
- **Implementation guidance** helping districts adapt model language to local needs
- **Regular updates** alerting districts when law changes require policy revisions
- **Policy review services** where OSBA staff audit district policy manuals for compliance and gaps

Districts are not required to use OSBA's model policies, but the vast majority do because it provides a legally vetted, professionally maintained foundation. OSBA membership includes access to the full policy library, consultation services, and regular policy update notifications.

---

### Policy Categories — The OSBA Section System

OSBA organizes policies using a letter-based section system. Understanding this structure helps you navigate your district's policy manual and locate relevant policies quickly.

| Section | Topic Area | Key Examples |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **A** | Foundations and Basic Commitments | District mission, goals, nondiscrimination, equal opportunity |
| **B** | Board Governance and Operations | Board authority, meetings, officers, committees, board member ethics, superintendent evaluation |
| **C** | General Administration | Superintendent duties, administrative organization, emergency plans |
| **D** | Fiscal Management | Budget, accounting, purchasing, audits, investments, bonding |
| **E** | Support Services | Facilities, transportation, food services, safety, technology |
| **F** | Facilities Development | Construction, renovation, naming of facilities, use of facilities |
| **G** | Personnel | Hiring, evaluation, compensation, leave, staff conduct, professional development |
| **H** | Negotiations | Collective bargaining framework, impasse procedures |
| **I** | Instruction | Curriculum, assessment, instructional materials, library, special programs, class size |
| **J** | Students | Admission, attendance, conduct, discipline, bullying, health, student records, due process |
| **K** | School-Community Relations | Public information, complaints, community use of facilities, volunteers, media relations |
| **L** | Education Service Districts | Relationship with ESDs (if applicable) |

Each policy within a section has a specific code. For example:
- **BBAA** — Board member authority (Section B)
- **DJC** — Bidding requirements (Section D)
- **GCBDA** — Family Medical Leave Act (Section G)
- **JFCF** — Bullying prevention (Section J)

> **💡 Tip:** Bookmark or save a digital copy of your district's policy manual index. When a community member raises a concern, being able to say *"That is covered under our Policy JFC on student conduct — let me share the link with you"* demonstrates competence and transparency.

### The Policy Adoption Process

Adopting or revising a board policy follows a deliberate, multi-step process designed to ensure thorough review and public transparency.

#### Step 1: Identification of Need
A policy change may be triggered by:
- A change in state or federal law (OSBA notifies districts)
- A board member or superintendent identifying a gap
- A community concern or complaint revealing inadequate policy
- Results from a periodic policy audit
- A recommendation from a policy committee
- Input from staff, unions, or community stakeholders

#### Step 2: Drafting
The superintendent (or designee) drafts the proposed policy language, often starting with the OSBA model. Legal counsel reviews the draft for compliance. The draft should include:
- The policy statement itself
- Legal references (ORS, OAR, federal law)
- Cross-references to related policies
- An effective date

#### Step 3: First Reading
The proposed policy is placed on the board meeting agenda as an **information/discussion item** for first reading. Board members review the language, ask questions, suggest changes, and hear any initial public comment. No vote is taken at first reading. The policy may be referred to a policy committee or sent back for revision.

#### Step 4: Public Input
Between the first and second readings, the public has the opportunity to review the proposed policy and provide comments. Some policies (e.g., curriculum-related) may require specific public input procedures under Oregon law.

#### Step 5: Second Reading and Adoption
At a subsequent board meeting, the policy comes back for second reading. The board may amend the language through the standard motion and amendment process, then votes to adopt the policy. A majority vote is required.

#### Step 6: Implementation
Once adopted, the superintendent develops or revises the corresponding administrative regulations and communicates the new policy to affected staff, students, and families.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board is eager to respond to a crisis (a bullying incident, a safety scare, a budget shortfall) by adopting a new policy immediately in a single reading. While most board policies allow single-reading adoption in urgent circumstances, bypassing the two-reading process means less public input, less board deliberation, and a higher risk of legal errors. Use single-reading adoption sparingly and only when truly necessary.

### Policy vs. Administrative Regulation — The Governance/Management Line

The distinction between board policy and administrative regulation is one of the most important structural concepts in school governance, and it directly mirrors the governance vs. management distinction covered in Module T1-M01.

| Feature | Board Policy | Administrative Regulation |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Who creates it** | Board (formal vote in public meeting) | Superintendent and staff |
| **What it addresses** | The "what" and "why" — direction, expectations, values | The "how" — specific procedures, steps, protocols |
| **Level of detail** | Broad, principled statements | Detailed, operational procedures |
| **Approval process** | First reading, second reading, board vote | Superintendent approval (no board vote required) |
| **Change process** | Requires board action to amend | Superintendent can modify as operational needs change |
| **Example** | "The district shall maintain a safe and orderly learning environment for all students." | "When a student violates the student conduct code, the following step-by-step process shall be followed: (1) Teacher documents the incident... (2) Principal meets with the student... (3) Parents are notified within 24 hours..." |

**Why this distinction matters:**
- If the board writes administrative-level detail into policy, the superintendent loses the flexibility to adapt procedures to changing circumstances without coming back to the board for a policy change — which can take two meetings.
- If the superintendent makes policy-level decisions without board direction, the governance structure breaks down and the board loses its primary tool of accountability.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A new board member, frustrated by a particular operational issue, writes detailed step-by-step procedures and brings them to the board as a proposed "policy." The proper approach: discuss the issue with the superintendent, ask what policy change (if any) would address it, and direct the superintendent to develop appropriate administrative regulations. The board sets the direction; the superintendent figures out the execution.

### How to Review and Update Policies — The Policy Review Cycle

Policies are living documents. Laws change, community values evolve, court decisions create new requirements, and operational needs shift. A policy that was legally compliant and operationally sound five years ago may be outdated today.

#### Establishing a Review Cycle
Best practice is to review a portion of the policy manual each year so the entire manual is reviewed over a **three- to five-year cycle**. For example:

| Year | Sections Reviewed |
|------|------------------|
| Year 1 | Sections A, B, C (Foundations, Board Operations, Administration) |
| Year 2 | Sections D, E, F (Fiscal, Support Services, Facilities) |
| Year 3 | Sections G, H (Personnel, Negotiations) |
| Year 4 | Sections I, J (Instruction, Students) |
| Year 5 | Sections K, L (Community Relations, ESDs) |

#### OSBA's Role in Policy Updates
OSBA continuously monitors legal changes and produces policy updates that districts can adopt. When a new law passes or a significant court decision is issued, OSBA sends update notifications to member districts identifying which policies are affected and providing recommended revised language.

#### Annual Priorities
In addition to the rotating cycle, certain policies should be reviewed annually:
- Financial policies (to reflect current budget reality)
- Student safety and discipline policies (to reflect current best practices)
- Any policy flagged by OSBA as requiring legal update
- Any policy that generated a complaint, grievance, or legal challenge during the year

> **💡 Tip:** Ask the superintendent to include a "policy review status" report in the board packet quarterly. This keeps the board informed about which policies have been reviewed, which are due for review, and which require updates due to legal changes.

### Required Policies Under Oregon Law

Oregon law mandates that school boards adopt policies on a wide range of topics. Failure to have these policies in place can result in legal liability, loss of state funding, or ODE (Oregon Department of Education) compliance actions. Key required policies include:

| ORS Reference | Required Policy |
|---|---|
| ORS 326.051 | Comprehensive school safety plan |
| ORS 332.107 | Nondiscrimination |
| ORS 336.071 | Instruction in Emergency Procedures (fire drills, earthquake drills, etc.) |
| ORS 339.240–339.250 | Student discipline (including suspension, expulsion, due process) |
| ORS 339.351–339.368 | Bullying, harassment, intimidation, cyberbullying, and teen dating violence prevention |
| ORS 342.726 | Teacher evaluation |
| ORS 659.850 | Discrimination in education prohibited (disability, sex, race, religion, etc.) |
| ORS 336.840 | Menstrual products in school restrooms |
| ORS 339.866 | Sunscreen use in schools |
| ORS 332.075 | Adoption of course of study and textbooks |
| ORS 327.109 | Continuous improvement plan |

This list is not exhaustive. OSBA's model policy service tracks all state-mandated policies and alerts districts when new requirements are enacted.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board assumes that because they have an OSBA-based policy manual, they are automatically in compliance with all legal requirements. OSBA provides excellent model policies, but it is the board's responsibility to actually *adopt* them. If your district has not reviewed its policies in several years, there may be gaps where required policies were never adopted or where outdated policies conflict with current law.

---

### The Role of Policy Committees

Many boards establish a standing **policy committee** to manage the policy review process. A typical policy committee:

- Consists of 2–3 board members (fewer than a quorum to avoid public meetings law issues), the superintendent (or designee), and sometimes legal counsel
- Meets regularly (monthly or quarterly) to review policies on the cycle
- Reviews OSBA update recommendations and makes recommendations to the full board
- Coordinates community input on significant policy changes
- Reports to the full board at regular meetings

The policy committee does not have the authority to adopt or amend policies — only the full board can do that. The committee's role is to do the detailed review work so that full board meetings can focus on discussion and decision-making rather than line-by-line editing.

---

### Handling Policy Complaints and Appeals

When a community member believes the district has violated a policy — or that a policy is inadequate — they may file a complaint. Most districts have a formal complaint process, often outlined in policy. Understanding this process is important because board members are frequently approached by constituents with concerns, and knowing the proper channels protects both the board member and the complainant.

#### The Typical Complaint Process

1. **Informal resolution:** The complainant raises the issue with the staff member or building administrator involved. Many concerns are resolved at this level through direct conversation and problem-solving.
2. **Formal complaint to superintendent:** If the informal process does not resolve the issue, the complainant files a written complaint with the superintendent or their designee. The written complaint should identify the specific policy alleged to have been violated, the facts of the situation, and the remedy sought.
3. **Superintendent investigation and response:** The superintendent investigates and provides a written response within a set timeframe (typically 10–30 business days, depending on board policy). The investigation may include interviews, document review, and consultation with legal counsel.
4. **Appeal to the board:** If the complainant is not satisfied with the superintendent's response, they may appeal to the board. The board reviews the complaint, the superintendent's response, and any additional information, and makes a final decision. The board's decision is typically the last step in the internal process.

**The board should not be involved in the complaint process until Step 4.** If a community member approaches a board member with a complaint, the board member should direct them to the formal process. Inserting yourself into the investigation at an earlier stage undermines the superintendent's authority and may compromise the board's ability to serve as an impartial appellate body later.

#### Special Categories of Complaints

Some complaints have specific procedures mandated by law:

| Complaint Type | Governing Law | Special Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Title IX (sex discrimination/harassment) | Federal Title IX regulations | Must follow federal investigation procedures; designated Title IX coordinator |
| Section 504 / ADA (disability discrimination) | Federal law | Must follow Section 504 grievance procedures |
| Instructional materials challenge | ORS 337.260 | Must be reviewed by a committee; specific timeline |
| Bullying/harassment | ORS 339.351–339.368 | Must follow district-specific investigation and reporting procedures |
| Employee grievance | Collective bargaining agreement | Must follow CBA grievance procedures, which may differ from board policy |

> **💡 Tip:** When the board hears a complaint appeal, approach it like a judge — impartially, based on the facts and the policy. Do not advocate for either side. Your job is to determine whether the policy was followed and whether the superintendent's response was reasonable. Ask: *"What does our policy say? Was the policy followed? Was the process fair?"*

### Policy Governance Models

Different approaches to policy governance exist, and understanding them helps new board members evaluate their own board's practices:

#### Traditional Model
The most common approach in Oregon. The board adopts detailed policies organized by topic (using the OSBA section system). Policies are specific enough to provide clear direction but broad enough to give the superintendent operational flexibility. Administrative regulations supplement policies with procedural detail.

**Strengths:** Comprehensive, well-established, supported by OSBA's model policy service.
**Weaknesses:** Can result in a large, complex policy manual that is difficult to keep current.

#### Carver Policy Governance Model
Developed by John Carver, this model emphasizes high-level "Ends" policies (what the district should achieve for students) and "Executive Limitations" policies (what the superintendent cannot do). It gives the superintendent broad latitude to manage within those boundaries. The Carver model is used by some Oregon boards but is less common than the traditional model.

**Strengths:** Clearly separates governance from management; focuses the board on outcomes rather than processes.
**Weaknesses:** Can be difficult to implement in a public school setting where state law requires specific policies; may feel too hands-off for some board members.

#### Hybrid Model
Some boards blend elements of both models — using Carver-style "Ends" language for strategic direction while maintaining traditional OSBA-format policies for legally required topics. This can provide the best of both worlds but requires careful design to avoid confusion.

> **💡 Tip:** Whatever model your board uses, the key question for every policy is: *"Does this tell the superintendent what we expect without telling them how to do their job?"* If the answer is yes, you have struck the right balance between governance and management.

### Common Policy Pitfalls for New Board Members

1. **Writing administrative procedures into policy.** Policy should say "what" and "why," not "how." When you find yourself specifying step-by-step procedures, you have crossed into administrative regulation territory.

2. **Adopting policy based on a single incident.** A bullying incident, a budget error, or a parent complaint may reveal a policy gap — but resist the urge to write a highly specific policy to address one situation. Good policy is general enough to apply to all similar situations.

3. **Ignoring the two-reading process.** Rushing a policy through without adequate review and public input leads to poorly drafted policies that may not withstand legal challenge.

4. **Failing to coordinate with the superintendent.** Before proposing a policy change, discuss it with the superintendent. They may already have administrative solutions, or they may identify legal or operational concerns you have not considered.

5. **Not checking OSBA first.** Before drafting policy language from scratch, check whether OSBA has a model policy on the topic. Chances are they do, and it has been legally vetted.

6. **Neglecting policy review.** An outdated policy manual is a legal liability waiting to happen. Ensure your board has an active policy review cycle.

7. **Confusing aspirational goals with enforceable policy.** A policy statement like "All students will graduate college-ready" is an aspiration, not an enforceable policy. Policy should establish concrete expectations, requirements, and standards.

8. **Failing to communicate new policies.** A policy that is adopted but never communicated to the staff and community that must follow it is worse than no policy at all.

### How Policies Interact with Collective Bargaining Agreements

One of the most complex areas of policy governance is the intersection between board policy and collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) — the contracts negotiated between the district and employee unions. Oregon is a collective bargaining state, and most districts have contracts with at least two unions: one representing licensed staff (teachers) and one representing classified staff (support employees). These agreements have significant implications for board policy.

**Key principles:**

- **CBAs take precedence** on matters covered by the agreement. If the CBA specifies teacher evaluation procedures, and board policy specifies a different procedure, the CBA controls during the life of the contract. This is true even if the board adopted the policy after the CBA was ratified.
- **Mandatory subjects of bargaining** include wages, hours, and working conditions. Under **ORS 243.650–243.782** (the Oregon Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act), the board cannot unilaterally change policy on these subjects without bargaining with the union. Doing so is an unfair labor practice.
- **Permissive subjects** may be bargained if both parties agree, but neither side can insist on bargaining them to impasse. The board retains discretion on permissive subjects.
- **Management rights** are typically reserved in a management rights clause within the CBA. The superintendent's ability to assign staff, determine curriculum, establish the academic calendar, and manage operations is usually protected — but the specific language varies by contract. Always check your specific CBA.
- **Impact bargaining:** Even when the board has the right to adopt a policy unilaterally (on a management rights topic), if the policy change has a significant impact on working conditions, the union may demand to bargain the *impacts* of the change. For example, the board can decide to adopt a new grading system (management right), but if it requires teachers to work additional hours, the union can demand to bargain the impact on workload.

#### Practical Guidance for Board Members

- **Read the CBAs.** Within your first month, review the current collective bargaining agreements. You do not need to memorize them, but you should understand the major provisions.
- **Ask before acting.** When revising policies that touch on employee working conditions, always consult with the superintendent and legal counsel about potential bargaining obligations. Adopting a policy change that violates a CBA can trigger an unfair labor practice complaint, grievance, or arbitration.
- **Understand the negotiation cycle.** CBAs typically run for 2–3 years. The board should plan policy changes that intersect with bargaining topics to coincide with contract negotiations when possible.
- **Respect the process.** Even when you disagree with a CBA provision, the board has agreed to it through the negotiation process. The proper avenue for change is the next round of bargaining, not a unilateral policy override.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board member, frustrated by teacher performance issues, proposes a new policy requiring additional classroom observations beyond what the CBA specifies. If teacher evaluation procedures are covered by the CBA, the board cannot unilaterally change them through policy — this would be an unfair labor practice. The proper approach is to direct the superintendent to address the issue in the next round of contract negotiations.

### Policy as a Living Governance Tool — Putting It All Together

Effective policy governance is not about having a thick manual on a shelf — it is about having a dynamic, current, legally sound set of guiding documents that the board, superintendent, staff, students, and community all understand and rely upon. Here are the hallmarks of excellent policy governance:

- **The board knows its policies.** Board members can reference relevant policies during discussions and use policy as the starting point for decision-making.
- **The manual is current.** Policies have been reviewed within the last five years, and legally required updates have been adopted promptly.
- **Policy and practice align.** The district's actual practices match what the policies say. If a gap exists, the board either revises the policy or directs the superintendent to change the practice.
- **The community has access.** The policy manual is published on the district website and available to anyone who requests it.
- **Policy is used proactively.** The board reviews relevant policies before making major decisions, rather than discovering policy gaps after problems arise.

> **💡 Tip:** At least once a year, ask the superintendent to provide a "policy health check" — a brief report identifying any policies that are outdated, any areas where practice does not match policy, and any OSBA updates that have not yet been adopted. Proactive policy maintenance is far less painful than reactive crisis management.

---

### Key Takeaways

- Board policy is the primary instrument of governance — it translates the board's vision into enforceable direction for the district.
- The policy hierarchy (federal law → state law → board policy → administrative regulation → procedures) must be maintained; each level must be consistent with those above it.
- OSBA provides an invaluable resource for model policies, legal compliance, and policy review.
- The two-reading adoption process ensures thorough review and public transparency.
- Policy says "what" and "why"; administrative regulation says "how." Maintaining this distinction preserves the governance/management boundary.
- Regular policy review cycles keep the manual current and legally defensible.
- Policies must be coordinated with collective bargaining agreements to avoid legal conflicts and unfair labor practice complaints.
- Board members should know their policy manual, advocate for regular review, and use policy as the foundation for all governance decisions.

As you prepare for the knowledge check, make sure you can:

- Describe the five levels of the policy hierarchy and how they relate to each other
- List the OSBA policy sections (A through L) and name the topic area for each
- Walk through the policy adoption process from identification of need through implementation
- Explain the difference between board policy and administrative regulation with examples
- Identify at least three policies required by Oregon law and their ORS references
- Describe how a policy complaint progresses from informal resolution to board appeal
