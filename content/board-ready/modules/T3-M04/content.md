## Overview

A vacancy on the Springfield Public Schools Board of Directors is a significant governance event. Whether caused by a resignation, a death, a move out of the district, a recall, or a disqualification, a vacancy means that one of the community's elected zones is temporarily without representation. Oregon law provides a clear framework for how boards must respond — but the process is more complex, more politically sensitive, and more consequential than most new board members realize.

This module covers the **Position 2 vacancy** in detail: the legal requirements, the appointment process, the political dynamics, the integration of a new member, and the lessons from how other Oregon districts have navigated similar situations.

---

### What Happened — The Position 2 Vacancy

Board vacancies can arise from several causes:

- **Resignation** — The most common reason. A member submits a written resignation to the board chair or superintendent.
- **Death** — The vacancy is immediate upon the member's passing.
- **Move out of the zone or district** — A member who no longer resides in the zone they represent (or in the district) is automatically disqualified under ORS 332.030.
- **Recall** — If voters in the zone successfully recall the member through the recall process (ORS 249.865–249.880).
- **Failure to attend** — Under ORS 332.030(3), a member who fails to attend board meetings for a specified period may be declared to have vacated the position.
- **Conviction of certain offenses** — A felony conviction may disqualify a member from continuing to serve.

Regardless of the cause, the legal process that follows is the same. The board must act within a defined timeline to fill the vacancy — or risk losing control of the appointment to the Lane County Education Service District (ESD).

> 💡 **Tip:** When a vacancy occurs, the superintendent's office should immediately notify the board chair, legal counsel, and the Oregon School Boards Association (OSBA). Having a pre-established vacancy policy (board policy BBBA or equivalent) ensures the process starts smoothly.

---

### The Legal Framework — ORS 332.030

Oregon Revised Statutes § 332.030 is the primary statute governing school board vacancies. Key provisions:

#### Who Declares the Vacancy

The board itself must formally declare the vacancy through a board action (motion and vote) at a public meeting. Even if the cause is obvious (e.g., a written resignation), the formal declaration starts the legal clock.

#### The 90-Day Window

Once the vacancy is declared, the board has **90 calendar days** to appoint a replacement. This is a hard deadline established by statute.

- **ORS 332.030(2):** *"A vacancy in the office of school board member shall be filled by appointment by the remaining members of the board. If the remaining members fail to fill the vacancy within 90 days after the vacancy occurs, the education service district board shall fill the vacancy by appointment."*

This means:
1. If the board cannot reach agreement within 90 days, the decision is made **for** them by the Lane ESD board.
2. The 90-day clock starts on the date the vacancy **occurs** (not the date the board formally declares it) — so delays in declaring the vacancy do not extend the timeline.

#### Majority of Remaining Members Required

The appointment requires a majority vote of the **remaining members** of the board. On a seven-member board with one vacancy, that means at least **four** of the six remaining members must vote in favor of the appointee.

If the board is deeply divided — for example, a 3–3 split — it cannot appoint, and the decision defaults to the ESD after 90 days.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Some board members assume they can simply wait and hold a special election instead of appointing. Oregon law does **not** give the board the option to decline to appoint and call a special election for a mid-term vacancy (unless specific conditions are met — see the special election section below). The statute presumes appointment as the default process.

---

### Qualifications for Appointees

Oregon law sets minimal qualifications for school board membership (ORS 332.018, ORS 332.030):

- **Age 18 or older**
- **Registered voter** in the State of Oregon
- **Resident of the zone** represented by the vacant position (for districts that elect by zone, as Springfield does)
- **Not an employee** of the district (ORS 332.016)

There is no requirement for any specific education, professional background, or prior board experience. The qualifications are deliberately minimal to ensure broad democratic access.

#### What the Board Should Look For

While the legal qualifications are minimal, the board should consider additional factors when evaluating candidates:

- **Skills and expertise the board currently lacks** — Does the board need financial expertise? Education background? Legal knowledge? Experience with diverse communities? An appointment is an opportunity to strengthen the board's collective capacity.
- **Diversity of perspective** — Consider whether the candidate brings a perspective not already represented on the board — racial/ethnic diversity, socioeconomic background, geographic diversity within the zone, age, or professional experience.
- **Community connection** — Does the candidate have relationships and trust within the Zone 2 community? Are they known and respected?
- **Governance temperament** — Can the candidate work collaboratively with other board members, disagree respectfully, and maintain the governance–management distinction? Past behavior in community roles is a good predictor.
- **Availability and commitment** — Board service requires significant time — regular meetings, work sessions, committee service, school events, community forums, and OSBA training. A candidate who cannot commit this time will not be effective.
- **Understanding of the current issues** — Does the candidate grasp the budget crisis, the strategic plan, and the district's key challenges? They need not be an expert, but basic awareness signals seriousness.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Boards sometimes prioritize candidates who are most similar to the departing member. The vacancy is an opportunity to **add** to the board's capacity, not simply replicate what was lost. Think about what the board needs going forward, not just what it had before.

#### Zone Residency

Springfield elects its board members by geographic zones. The appointee for Position 2 **must reside** within the boundaries of Zone 2. The superintendent's office should verify residency using voter registration records and the district's zone boundary maps.

> 💡 **Tip:** Zone boundaries are established by board policy and may not align with school attendance boundaries. Verify the zone map with the district's elections officer or the Lane County Elections Office before advertising the vacancy.

### The Appointment Process — Step by Step

While Oregon law prescribes the legal requirements, the **process** for soliciting, evaluating, and selecting an appointee is largely up to the board. Best practice — and Springfield board policy — typically includes the following steps:

| Step | Action | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Board formally declares the vacancy at a public meeting | Board Chair / Board | Day 1 |
| 2 | Public announcement of vacancy and application process | Superintendent's office | Days 1–7 |
| 3 | Application period opens (minimum 2–3 weeks recommended) | Superintendent's office | Days 7–28 |
| 4 | Applications received and screened for eligibility | Superintendent's office | Days 28–35 |
| 5 | Candidates interviewed by the board at a public meeting | Full Board | Days 35–55 |
| 6 | Board deliberates and votes on appointment | Full Board | Days 55–75 |
| 7 | Appointed member is sworn in and seated | Board Chair / Superintendent | Days 75–85 |
| 8 | Orientation and onboarding begins | Superintendent / OSBA | Days 85–90+ |

#### Step 1: Declare the Vacancy

At the next regular or special board meeting following the event that created the vacancy, the board should adopt a resolution formally declaring the vacancy for Position 2. The resolution should state:
- The position number and zone
- The cause of the vacancy (resignation, etc.)
- The effective date of the vacancy
- The 90-day deadline for appointment
- The board's intent to follow its vacancy policy

#### Step 2: Public Announcement

The superintendent's office should publish a notice of the vacancy and the application process through:
- The district website
- Local newspapers (The Springfield Times, The Register-Guard)
- Social media channels
- Email to community organizations, neighborhood associations, and civic groups
- Posting in school buildings and community centers
- Notification to OSBA

The announcement should include:
- A description of the position, including zone boundaries
- Qualifications (residency, voter registration, age)
- How to apply (application form, deadline, submission method)
- The expected timeline for interviews and appointment
- A brief description of board member responsibilities and time commitment

#### Step 3: Application Period

A minimum application period of **two to three weeks** is recommended to allow broad community participation. Shorter periods may be perceived as exclusionary or designed to favor a pre-selected candidate.

The application form should request:
- Name, address, contact information
- Confirmation of Zone 2 residency and voter registration
- Statement of interest (why the candidate wants to serve)
- Relevant experience and skills
- Availability to attend regular board meetings (typically twice monthly) and other board commitments
- Any potential conflicts of interest

#### Step 4: Eligibility Screening

The superintendent's office should verify:
- Zone residency (using voter registration or address verification)
- Voter registration status
- Age (18+)
- Non-employee status

Applications that do not meet eligibility requirements should be disqualified and the applicant notified. **This is an administrative function, not a board decision** — the board should not be involved in screening for basic eligibility.

#### Step 5: Candidate Interviews

Interviews should be conducted **in public** at a noticed board meeting. This is critical for transparency and community trust.

Best practices for interviews:
- Prepare a **standard set of questions** asked of all candidates (ensures fairness)
- Allow each candidate equal time (typically 15–20 minutes)
- Questions should explore:
  - Understanding of the board's governance role
  - Knowledge of district issues and priorities
  - Ability to work collaboratively with other board members
  - Commitment to attending meetings and doing the work
  - Perspectives on the district's key challenges (e.g., the budget deficit, equity, student outcomes)
- Allow board members to ask follow-up questions
- **Do not** allow public comment to become a de facto endorsement or opposition forum — the decision is the board's, not the audience's

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Conducting candidate interviews or deliberations in **executive session**. Under Oregon Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610–192.695), board deliberations on a vacancy appointment must be conducted in public. There is no executive session exception for this purpose. Interviewing candidates behind closed doors exposes the board to legal challenge.

#### Step 6: Board Deliberation and Vote

After interviews, the board deliberates — in public — and votes. Several formats are common:

- **Ranked voting:** Each board member ranks candidates; scores are tallied.
- **Sequential motions:** A member nominates a candidate; the board votes. If the motion fails, another candidate is nominated.
- **Discussion followed by motion:** Open discussion of candidates' qualifications, followed by a nomination and vote.

The appointment requires a **majority vote of the remaining members** (4 of 6 on a seven-member board). If no candidate receives a majority on the first vote, the board may:
- Continue deliberating
- Take additional votes
- Reopen the application process (if time permits within the 90 days)

#### Step 7: Swearing In

Once appointed, the new member must take the **oath of office** prescribed by the Oregon Constitution (Article XV, § 3) before being seated. The oath is typically administered by the board chair or the superintendent at a regular board meeting.

The appointed member may begin participating in board business immediately upon taking the oath.

#### Step 8: Orientation

The new member should receive:
- A comprehensive orientation (see Module T2-M01 on board orientation)
- Access to board materials, email, and the board portal
- A copy of current board policies
- Introduction to district leadership
- Mentorship from an experienced board member
- Enrollment in OSBA training programs

### The Appointed Member's Term

A critical detail: the **appointed member does not serve the remainder of the vacated member's full term.** Under ORS 332.030:

- The appointee serves until the **next regular school board election** at which the position can be filled.
- School board elections in Oregon are held in **May of odd-numbered years** (ORS 255.335).
- At that election, voters will elect someone to serve the **remainder of the original term**.

For example, if Position 2's original term was set to expire in June 2029, and the vacancy is filled by appointment in 2026, the appointee would serve until the May 2027 election. The winner of that election would then serve through June 2029.

This means an appointee may serve for as little as a few months or as long as nearly two years, depending on when in the election cycle the vacancy occurs.

> 💡 **Tip:** Candidates for appointment should understand that they may need to **run for election** within a year or two if they wish to continue serving. An appointee who is unwilling to run may create another transition shortly after being seated.

### Historical Context — Springfield's Past Vacancies

Springfield Public Schools has navigated board vacancies several times in its history. While each situation is unique, common patterns emerge:

- The district has historically used an **open application and public interview process** consistent with OSBA recommendations.
- In some cases, former board members have been appointed to fill vacancies — this is legally permissible but can be controversial.
- The most successful appointments have been those where the board reached **consensus** (or near-consensus) on the appointee, rather than a bare majority vote that left lingering divisions.
- Community engagement in the process has varied — higher engagement generally produces greater public acceptance of the appointee.

---

### The Politics of Appointment

Board vacancy appointments are inherently political. Even in ostensibly nonpartisan school board governance, real dynamics are at play:

- **Existing board members may try to appoint someone who shares their views** on contested issues (budget, curriculum, labor relations). This is human nature, but it can undermine public trust if it appears that the fix is in.
- **Community advocacy groups** may mobilize to support particular candidates. While community input is valuable, the decision must remain the board's.
- **Perceptions of fairness** matter enormously. A process that appears rushed, secretive, or pre-determined will generate controversy even if the outcome is defensible.
- **The appointee's first votes** will be closely watched. If the new member immediately sides with a particular faction on a controversial issue, critics will allege the appointment was politically motivated.

**Best practices for managing the politics:**
1. Establish and follow a **transparent, publicly announced process** — and stick to it.
2. Use **consistent interview questions** for all candidates.
3. Deliberate **in public** — even if it's uncomfortable.
4. Choose a candidate based on **qualifications and community needs**, not factional loyalty.
5. If the board is deeply divided, consider appointing a **"bridge" candidate** — someone respected across factions who can serve competently until the next election.

### Legal Risks

Several legal risks attend the vacancy process:

- **Public Meetings Law violation:** Conducting deliberations or interviews in executive session, or making decisions outside of a properly noticed meeting, violates ORS 192.610–192.695 and can result in voiding the appointment.
- **Discrimination claims:** If the process appears to exclude candidates based on protected characteristics (race, gender, religion, political affiliation), it could generate legal or political challenges.
- **Residency challenges:** If the appointee's Zone 2 residency is disputed, the appointment could be challenged. Verify residency carefully.
- **Failure to appoint within 90 days:** As noted, this defaults the decision to the Lane ESD board — an outcome that most boards consider a failure of governance.
- **Conflicts of interest:** If a board member has a personal or financial relationship with a candidate, they should disclose it and consider recusing from the vote (ORS 244.020, ORS 244.120).

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes discuss candidates informally — via email, text, phone, or in the parking lot after meetings. Any communication among a quorum (4+ members) about the appointment outside of a public meeting may constitute a **serial meeting** in violation of Public Meetings Law. Keep all substantive discussion in the boardroom.

---

### The Special Election Alternative

Under limited circumstances, a **special election** may be used instead of (or in addition to) appointment:

- **ORS 249.865** allows for special elections to fill vacancies in certain public offices, including school board positions.
- A special election is **not the default** — appointment is the presumed method under ORS 332.030.
- If the board believes a special election is more appropriate (e.g., the vacancy occurs early in the term, or the community is deeply divided), it may choose to call one — but this is **discretionary**, not required.
- Special elections are **expensive** (typically $50,000–$150,000 depending on whether they can be consolidated with an existing election date) and **time-consuming** (60–90 days minimum for election administration).
- In practice, most Oregon school boards use appointment for mid-term vacancies and reserve special elections for extraordinary circumstances.

| Factor | Appointment | Special Election |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Minimal (staff time) | $50,000–$150,000 |
| **Timeline** | 30–90 days | 90–180 days |
| **Democratic legitimacy** | Moderate (board decision) | High (voter decision) |
| **Board control** | High | Low (voters decide) |
| **Legal default** | Yes (ORS 332.030) | No (discretionary) |
| **Community perception** | Varies | Generally positive |
| **Risk of prolonged vacancy** | Low | Moderate |

> 💡 **Tip:** If the board decides to appoint, it can reduce concerns about democratic legitimacy by running a **highly transparent, community-engaged process**. If the board decides on a special election, it should appoint a temporary member to serve in the interim so that the full board can function.

### Board Dynamics After Appointment

Integrating a new board member — especially one who was appointed rather than elected — requires intentional effort:

#### Orientation

The appointed member should receive the same comprehensive orientation as any newly elected member (see Module T2-M01). This includes:
- District overview and strategic plan
- Budget and financial overview
- Board policies and procedures
- Collective bargaining overview
- Legal obligations (ethics, public meetings, public records)
- Meeting with the superintendent and cabinet
- School site visits

#### Mentorship

Pair the new member with an experienced board colleague who can:
- Explain unwritten norms and traditions
- Provide context on past decisions
- Help navigate the first few meetings
- Serve as a sounding board for questions

#### Building Legitimacy

An appointed member may face skepticism from community members who question their democratic mandate. To build legitimacy:
- Be **visibly engaged** — attend community events, forums, and school functions
- Be **transparent** about your appointment and your intent (will you run for election?)
- Build relationships with all board members, not just those who supported your appointment
- Demonstrate competence and preparation at meetings
- Listen more than you speak in the first few months

#### Avoiding the "Lame Duck" Trap

If the appointee knows they will serve for only a short period before the next election, there is a temptation to be passive — to avoid controversy, defer to others, and coast until the election. Resist this temptation. The community needs a full, functioning board at all times, and the appointed member has the same legal authority and responsibilities as every other member.

### What Other Oregon Districts Do Differently

Practices vary across Oregon:

- **Portland Public Schools:** Uses a detailed application and public interview process. Has historically attracted 20–40 applicants for vacancies due to its size and visibility.
- **Bend-La Pine:** Has used a community advisory panel to screen and recommend finalists to the board — adding a layer of community input before the board interviews.
- **Salem-Keizer:** Has experienced contentious appointment processes that resulted in narrow votes and public criticism. Lessons learned include the importance of a structured, transparent process.
- **Medford:** Has used a combination of written applications and public forums where candidates present to the community before the board interviews.
- **Eugene 4J:** As a neighboring district, Eugene's practices are particularly relevant to Springfield. Eugene has used both straightforward board interviews and community input sessions in past vacancy appointments.

No single approach is "right" — but the most successful processes share common features: transparency, consistency, broad outreach, and public deliberation.

### The Impact on Board Business During a Vacancy

While the vacancy exists, the board operates with reduced membership. This has practical implications:

- **Quorum:** On a seven-member board, a quorum is four members. With one vacancy, six members remain, so a quorum is still achievable — but absences become more consequential. If even two of the remaining six members are absent, the board cannot conduct business.
- **Vote margins:** Controversial decisions that might have passed 4–3 on a full board now require 4 of 6 — a higher effective threshold. This can delay action on divisive issues.
- **Committee assignments:** If the departing member served on board committees (budget committee, policy committee, bargaining oversight), those assignments must be reassigned or left vacant temporarily.
- **Community representation:** The constituents in Zone 2 have no direct representative on the board during the vacancy. Board members should be especially attentive to Zone 2 concerns during this period.

For these reasons, filling the vacancy promptly is not just a legal obligation — it is a practical governance necessity.

> 💡 **Tip:** Consider scheduling any particularly significant or controversial board decisions (e.g., policy adoptions, contract approvals) after the vacancy is filled, if the timeline permits. Decisions made by an incomplete board may face legitimacy questions from the community.

---

### Practical Timeline — Vacancy to Seated Member

Assuming the vacancy is declared promptly and the board follows a standard process:

| Week | Activity |
|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Vacancy declared at board meeting; public announcement issued |
| **Weeks 1–3** | Outreach to community organizations; media coverage |
| **Weeks 2–4** | Application period open |
| **Week 5** | Eligibility screening completed; applicant list finalized |
| **Weeks 6–7** | Board interviews candidates at public meeting(s) |
| **Week 8** | Board deliberates and votes on appointment |
| **Week 9** | Appointed member takes oath of office and is seated |
| **Weeks 9–12** | Orientation, onboarding, mentorship begins |

This timeline fits comfortably within the 90-day statutory window while allowing adequate time for community engagement.

### Summary

Filling a board vacancy is one of the most consequential actions a school board can take. The appointed member will cast votes, set policy, and represent the community — with the same authority as any elected member. Oregon law provides a clear framework, but the quality of the process depends on the board's commitment to transparency, fairness, and community engagement.

Do it well, and the board emerges stronger — with a new member who brings fresh perspective and energy. Do it poorly, and the board faces months of controversy, legal risk, and eroded public trust. The process matters as much as the outcome.
