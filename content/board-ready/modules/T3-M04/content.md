## Overview

As of February 2026, Position 2 on the Springfield School District 19 Board of Directors is vacant. This vacancy has triggered a formal appointment process governed by Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 332, which outlines how school board vacancies must be filled. For new and prospective board members, this situation offers a real-time case study in board governance — illustrating how Oregon law, district policy, and public process intersect when a seat becomes open.

Vacancies on a school board can arise for several reasons: resignation, death, disqualification, or a member moving outside their zone boundaries. Regardless of the cause, Oregon law requires the remaining board members to act within a defined timeframe to fill the seat. The process is designed to ensure continuity of governance while preserving public trust and transparency. If the board fails to appoint a replacement within the statutory window, the authority to fill the vacancy may shift to the county or the local Education Service District (ESD) — a consequence that underscores the urgency of timely action.

Springfield SD 19 has responded to the Position 2 vacancy by opening a public application process. Interested community members were invited to submit applications, and the board scheduled a Special Meeting on February 20, 2026 dedicated to interviewing candidates. The interviews were conducted in public session, consistent with Oregon's public meetings law. Following the interviews, the board will deliberate and vote — also in public — to select an appointee. This process ensures that the community can observe how its elected representatives make this important decision.

It is important for all board members to understand the distinction between an appointed term and an elected term. A person appointed to fill a vacancy does not serve a full four-year term. Instead, the appointee serves only until the next regular school board election, at which point the position appears on the ballot and voters choose who will hold the seat for the remaining or next full term. This distinction preserves the democratic principle that voters ultimately decide who represents them on the board.

## Key Concepts

### ORS 332 Vacancy Provisions

Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 332 governs the local administration of education, including the procedures for filling school board vacancies. When a vacancy occurs, the remaining board members are required to appoint a replacement within a specific timeframe — generally within a set number of days. The statute is clear that the board must act; inaction is not an option. If the board fails to make an appointment within the allowed period, the authority to fill the seat may transfer to the Lane County Education Service District or the county government. This legal framework ensures that school boards maintain a quorum and can continue to conduct the public's business without prolonged gaps in representation.

### The Public Application and Interview Process

Springfield's approach to filling the Position 2 vacancy follows a transparent, community-oriented process. The district publicly announced the vacancy and invited applications from qualified residents within the Position 2 zone. Applicants submitted their qualifications and statements of interest, which were reviewed by the board. The board then scheduled a Special Meeting — February 20, 2026 — specifically for the purpose of interviewing candidates. These interviews were held in open session, allowing community members to attend and observe. After interviews, the board deliberates and votes in public to select the appointee. This process reflects best practices in governance transparency and community engagement.

### Appointed Service vs. Elected Term

A critical distinction in Oregon school board governance is the difference between serving by appointment and serving by election. When a board appoints someone to fill a vacancy, that person serves only until the next regular school board election — not for a full four-year term. At the next election, the position goes on the ballot and voters decide who will hold the seat going forward. This means an appointed member may serve for only a few months or up to nearly two years, depending on when the vacancy occurred relative to the election cycle. The appointee has full voting rights and all the responsibilities of any other board member during their period of service, but their tenure is inherently temporary until confirmed or replaced by voters.

### The February 20 Special Meeting

The Special Meeting held on February 20, 2026 was convened for the specific purpose of interviewing candidates for the Position 2 vacancy. Special meetings differ from regular meetings in that they are called for a defined purpose and typically have a narrower agenda. Under Oregon public meetings law, special meetings must be properly noticed to the public, and all deliberations and votes must occur in open session. The board's decision to dedicate an entire meeting to candidate interviews signals the seriousness with which it approaches the appointment process and its commitment to giving each candidate a fair and thorough hearing.

### Continuity of Governance

The vacancy appointment process exists to ensure that the board can continue to function effectively even when a seat is unexpectedly open. A five-member board operating with only four members still has a quorum (three members), but a prolonged vacancy can strain the board's capacity, complicate vote margins, and reduce the diversity of perspectives at the table. Prompt action to fill vacancies is not just a legal requirement — it is a governance best practice that ensures the community remains fully represented in district decision-making.
