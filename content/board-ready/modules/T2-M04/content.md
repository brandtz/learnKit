## Overview

The Oregon School Boards Association (OSBA) is a nonprofit, member-driven professional association that serves school board members across all 197 school districts in Oregon, as well as education service districts (ESDs) and community college boards. Founded in 1946, OSBA has grown into one of the most comprehensive school board associations in the country, providing an integrated suite of services — legislative advocacy, policy development, legal guidance, training, labor relations support, and insurance programs — that together form the backbone of support for local education governance in Oregon.

For a new board member, OSBA is arguably the single most valuable external resource available to you. From the moment you are elected or appointed, OSBA offers onboarding materials, training programs, and direct access to experienced governance professionals who can answer your questions and help you navigate the complexities of board service. Unlike many organizations that serve school districts, OSBA exists specifically to serve *board members* — not administrators, not teachers, not students directly, but the elected and appointed citizens who govern Oregon's public schools.

OSBA membership is held at the **district level**, not by individual board members. When your district pays its annual OSBA membership dues, every board member in the district automatically gains access to the full range of OSBA services. Springfield School District has been a continuous OSBA member, and your membership gives you access to everything described in this module — policy tools, legal hotline, training events, advocacy representation, and much more.

This module provides a comprehensive guide to OSBA — its governance structure, the services it offers, how to use those services effectively, and why active engagement with OSBA strengthens both your individual effectiveness and your board's collective governance capacity.

### OSBA Governance Structure

OSBA is governed by its own board of directors, which is composed of school board members elected from OSBA's regional districts across the state. Understanding OSBA's internal governance helps you see how the association ensures its services are responsive to member needs.

#### Board of Directors

- OSBA's board of directors consists of approximately **18 members**, representing the association's geographic regions
- Board members are elected by OSBA member districts within their regions
- The OSBA board sets strategic direction, approves the association's budget, and adopts positions on legislative priorities
- Officers include a President, President-Elect, Vice President, and Past President, rotating annually

#### Executive Director and Staff

- The OSBA board hires an **Executive Director** who manages the association's day-to-day operations
- OSBA staff includes specialists in policy, legal services, labor relations, legislative affairs, communications, and training
- The staff is headquartered in Salem, with regional presence through field representatives

#### Regional Structure

Oregon is divided into **OSBA regions** that correspond roughly to geographic areas of the state. Each region:

- Elects representatives to the OSBA board of directors
- Holds **regional meetings** (typically 2-4 per year) where board members from nearby districts gather to discuss common issues, hear legislative updates, and network
- Provides a forum for local boards to share best practices and raise concerns that OSBA staff can address

| OSBA Region | Approximate Coverage |
|---|---|
| Region 1 | Clatsop, Columbia, Tillamook, Washington counties |
| Region 2 | Multnomah County |
| Region 3 | Clackamas, Hood River, Wasco, Sherman counties |
| Region 4 | Marion, Polk, Yamhill counties |
| Region 5 | Linn, Benton, Lincoln counties |
| Region 6 | Lane County |
| Region 7 | Douglas, Coos, Curry counties |
| Region 8 | Jackson, Josephine counties |
| Region 9 | Klamath, Lake counties |
| Region 10 | Deschutes, Jefferson, Crook, Wheeler counties |
| Region 11 | Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Morrow, Gilliam, Grant counties |
| Region 12 | Baker, Malheur, Harney counties |

> 💡 **Tip:** Attend your regional meetings. They are one of the most efficient ways to network with board members from neighboring districts, learn about regional issues, and stay connected to OSBA's legislative work. Regional meetings are informal, welcoming to new members, and often include presentations on timely topics.

---

### Legislative Advocacy

One of OSBA's most important functions — and one that justifies membership on its own — is **legislative advocacy**. OSBA serves as the collective voice of Oregon's school boards in the Oregon Legislature, advocating for policies and funding that support public education and protect local governance authority.

#### How OSBA's Legislative Process Works

1. **Member Input:** Before each legislative session, OSBA surveys its member districts to identify legislative priorities. Board members can submit resolutions through their regional structure.

2. **Legislative Policy Committee (LPC):** The LPC is a representative body of board members from across the state that meets during the legislative session to review bills, set positions, and guide OSBA's advocacy strategy. The LPC acts as the "voice of the membership" on legislative matters.

3. **OSBA Lobbyists and Policy Staff:** OSBA employs professional lobbyists who monitor every education-related bill in the legislature, testify before committees, and build relationships with legislators. OSBA tracks hundreds of bills each session and takes formal positions (support, oppose, or monitor) on dozens of them.

4. **Advocacy Alerts:** During session, OSBA sends regular **Legislative Highlights** and urgent action alerts to member districts, asking board members to contact their legislators on critical votes. These alerts include talking points and contact information, making it easy for board members to participate in advocacy.

5. **Post-Session Summary:** After each session, OSBA publishes a comprehensive summary of education legislation that passed, was amended, or died, along with an analysis of impacts on local districts.

#### Priority Legislative Areas

OSBA consistently advocates on several recurring themes:

- **Adequate and stable school funding** — Supporting the State School Fund and resisting unfunded mandates
- **Local control** — Protecting the authority of local boards to make governance decisions
- **Equitable funding formulas** — Ensuring the ADMw formula reflects actual student needs
- **Labor relations** — Maintaining balanced collective bargaining frameworks
- **Capital construction** — Supporting bond and facilities funding mechanisms
- **Student safety and well-being** — Mental health funding, safe schools legislation
- **Educator workforce** — Recruitment, retention, and licensure flexibility

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Some board members assume OSBA's legislative positions automatically reflect their district's views. They do not — OSBA positions are developed through the LPC and member resolution process. If your board has strong views on a legislative issue, participate in the resolution process and consider having a board member serve on the LPC. Silence means your perspective may not be represented.

> 💡 **Tip:** Establish a relationship with your local state legislators early in your board tenure. OSBA can help facilitate introductions. When OSBA sends an action alert during session, a personal email or phone call from a local board member to a legislator carries significant weight — far more than a form letter.

---

### Policy Services

OSBA's policy services are among the most heavily used and highest-value services for member districts. Maintaining a comprehensive, legally compliant policy manual is one of a board's core responsibilities, and OSBA makes this manageable even for districts without dedicated policy staff.

#### Model Policies

OSBA maintains a complete library of **model policies** that cover every area of school district governance and operations — from board organization and meetings to student conduct, personnel, fiscal management, facilities, and community relations. These model policies are:

- Written by OSBA policy and legal staff
- Aligned with current Oregon law (ORS) and administrative rules (OAR)
- Updated regularly to reflect legislative changes and court decisions
- Customizable — districts adopt them as-is or modify them to fit local needs

#### OSBA Policy Online

**OSBA Policy Online** (sometimes called "Policy Reference Manual" or "Online Policy") is a web-based tool that gives member districts access to:

- The complete set of OSBA model policies
- An integrated cross-reference system linking policies to relevant ORS and OAR sections
- Annotation tools that let districts track local modifications
- A policy update subscription service that alerts districts when model policies change due to new legislation or rule changes

When the Oregon Legislature passes a bill that affects school policy — say, a new student discipline law — OSBA's policy team analyzes the law, drafts updated model policy language, and pushes the update to districts through Policy Online. This ensures districts don't have to independently track every legal change.

#### Policy Update Cycles

After each legislative session, OSBA releases **policy update packets** organized by priority:

- **Mandatory updates** — Policy changes required by new law (districts must adopt)
- **Recommended updates** — Changes reflecting best practices or clarifying existing policy
- **Optional updates** — Enhancements districts may choose to adopt

> 💡 **Tip:** If your district subscribes to OSBA Policy Online, ask your superintendent or board secretary to walk you through how to access it. As a board member, you should know how to find your district's current policies and understand the policy adoption/revision process. Also, when OSBA releases mandatory post-session policy updates, ensure your board schedules time to review and adopt them — delaying puts the district out of compliance.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Some boards adopt OSBA model policies verbatim without reviewing them for local fit. While the models are well-written, every district has unique circumstances. Take the time to discuss whether each policy serves your community appropriately. OSBA expects customization — that's why the policies are called "models."

### Board Training Programs

OSBA invests heavily in board member education, recognizing that effective governance requires ongoing learning. The training portfolio includes:

#### New Board Member Orientation

OSBA offers a structured orientation for newly elected and appointed board members, typically held in January following November elections and available on-demand for mid-term appointees. The orientation covers:

- Roles and responsibilities of board members
- Board-superintendent relationship
- Oregon public meeting law
- Parliamentary procedure basics
- Ethics and conflicts of interest
- Introduction to school finance
- Overview of OSBA resources

#### Continuing Education Workshops

Throughout the year, OSBA hosts workshops on topics such as:

- School finance deep-dives
- Superintendent evaluation best practices
- Collective bargaining and labor relations
- Board self-assessment
- Community engagement strategies
- Equity and culturally responsive governance
- Legal updates

#### Board Self-Assessment Tool

OSBA offers a **board self-assessment instrument** that allows boards to evaluate their own governance effectiveness as a team. The assessment covers areas like:

- Board-superintendent relations
- Policy governance
- Community engagement
- Meeting effectiveness
- Strategic planning
- Board member conduct and ethics

The self-assessment is typically facilitated by an OSBA governance consultant and results in a confidential report with recommendations. It is an excellent tool for identifying governance strengths and areas for improvement.

#### Governance Leadership Institute

The **OSBA Governance Leadership Institute** is an advanced training program for experienced board members who want to deepen their leadership skills. The multi-session program covers strategic governance, systems thinking, equity leadership, and advanced communication skills. Graduates often become governance mentors in their regions.

#### Boardsmanship Guide

The *Boardsmanship* guide is OSBA's flagship publication for board members — a comprehensive handbook covering every aspect of school board service in Oregon. Topics include:

- The legal framework for board authority (ORS 332)
- Board meeting management and public meeting law
- The board's role in policy development
- Superintendent hiring, evaluation, and relations
- School finance and budget oversight
- Collective bargaining
- Ethics, conflicts of interest, and nepotism
- Community relations and public engagement
- School safety and emergency management

Every new board member should receive and read the *Boardsmanship* guide within their first 30 days. It serves as both an onboarding text and an ongoing reference.

> 💡 **Tip:** Don't stop learning after orientation. OSBA's workshops and events are designed for ongoing development. Even veteran board members attend OSBA trainings regularly to stay current on legal changes, emerging issues, and governance best practices. Budget time and travel funds for at least 2-3 OSBA events per year.

---

### Legal Services

OSBA provides legal support to member districts through several channels. It is important to understand both the scope and the limits of this service.

#### Legal Hotline

OSBA operates a **legal hotline** that member districts can call for quick guidance on governance and legal questions. Common topics include:

- Public meeting law questions (executive session criteria, notice requirements)
- Conflicts of interest and ethics
- Board member authority and roles
- Student records and FERPA
- Policy interpretation
- Employment law basics

The hotline is staffed by OSBA attorneys and is available during business hours. Response time is typically same-day for urgent matters.

#### Legal Workshops and Publications

OSBA regularly publishes **legal advisories** when new laws or court decisions affect school governance. These advisories break down complex legal changes into plain language and explain what boards need to do in response. OSBA also offers legal workshops at the annual convention and as standalone events.

#### Amicus Briefs

When court cases have significant implications for school governance statewide, OSBA may file **amicus curiae ("friend of the court") briefs** on behalf of its membership. These briefs present the collective perspective of Oregon school boards on legal questions that could set precedent.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Treating the OSBA legal hotline as a substitute for your district's own legal counsel. OSBA provides general guidance and information — it does not represent individual districts in legal matters, does not provide formal legal opinions for specific disputes, and cannot advise on active litigation. For district-specific legal issues (employee grievances, student discipline appeals, contract disputes), always consult your district's retained attorney.

---

### Labor Relations Support

Labor relations — collective bargaining with employee unions — is one of the most complex and high-stakes areas of board governance. OSBA provides significant support:

#### Bargaining Assistance

- **Chief negotiator services:** OSBA can provide an experienced labor relations consultant to serve as or assist your district's chief negotiator during contract bargaining
- **Bargaining strategy consultation:** OSBA staff help boards develop bargaining priorities, analyze union proposals, and understand legal requirements under the Oregon Employment Relations Board (ERB) and ORS 243
- **Contract review:** OSBA can review draft collective bargaining agreements for legal compliance and comparison with statewide trends

#### Salary and Benefits Surveys

OSBA conducts **statewide salary and benefits surveys** that compile compensation data from districts across Oregon. These surveys are invaluable for:

- Setting competitive salary schedules
- Benchmarking benefits packages against comparable districts
- Preparing for bargaining with data-backed proposals
- Understanding regional labor market conditions

#### Mediation and Arbitration Support

When bargaining reaches impasse, Oregon law provides for mediation and, in some cases, binding arbitration. OSBA can:

- Provide guidance on the impasse process under ORS 243.712
- Assist with preparation for mediation sessions
- Help districts prepare for interest arbitration (for certain employee groups)
- Connect districts with experienced labor attorneys

> 💡 **Tip:** Even if your district has an experienced human resources director, consider engaging OSBA's labor relations services during major bargaining cycles. OSBA consultants bring statewide perspective on trends, settlements, and legal developments that no single district can match. The cost is modest compared to the financial impact of a poorly negotiated contract.

---

### Insurance Programs

OSBA sponsors two major insurance programs that serve the majority of Oregon school districts:

#### PACE (Property and Casualty Coverage for Education)

**PACE** is an insurance pool created by OSBA that provides property, casualty, liability, and vehicle coverage to member districts. Key features:

- **Pool structure** — PACE operates as a self-insured pool where member districts share risk, resulting in more stable premiums than the commercial insurance market
- **Coverage** — Property damage, general liability, auto liability, errors and omissions, employment practices liability, and cyber liability
- **Risk management** — PACE provides risk management training, loss prevention consulting, and safety resources to help districts reduce claims
- **Dividends** — In years with favorable loss experience, PACE returns dividends to member districts

#### OSBAIT (Oregon School Boards Association Insurance Trust)

**OSBAIT** provides **liability coverage** specifically designed for school districts, including:

- Board member and officer liability
- Employment practices liability
- Civil rights defense
- Student injury liability

OSBAIT, like PACE, operates as a trust funded by member contributions and provides coverage tailored to the unique risks that school districts face. Commercial insurers often don't understand education-specific risks, making OSBAIT's specialized approach particularly valuable.

> 💡 **Tip:** Ask your business manager which OSBA insurance programs your district participates in and when renewals occur. Understanding your district's insurance coverage and risk profile is an important part of financial oversight. Also, take advantage of the risk management training and resources these programs offer — they can help prevent costly claims.

---

### Communications and Public Engagement Resources

OSBA helps boards communicate effectively with their communities through several channels:

- **OSBA Journal** — The association's magazine, published several times a year, featuring articles on governance, policy, and education issues relevant to board members
- **E-newsletters and updates** — Regular electronic communications covering legislative news, legal updates, upcoming events, and member spotlights
- **Social media and web resources** — OSBA maintains an active online presence with resources, toolkits, and timely information
- **Communications consulting** — OSBA can advise districts on community engagement strategies, bond/levy campaign communications (within legal limits), and crisis communications
- **Template resources** — OSBA provides templates for board communications, including community newsletters, annual reports, and public engagement materials

---

### The Annual OSBA Convention

The **OSBA Annual Convention** is the largest gathering of school board members in Oregon, typically held in November in Portland. The convention is a cornerstone event for board member professional development and networking.

#### What to Expect

- **Duration:** Typically two full days (Friday and Saturday)
- **Attendance:** 800-1,200 attendees including board members, superintendents, and education leaders
- **Sessions:** 50+ breakout sessions covering topics such as school finance, legal updates, equity, board governance, student achievement, labor relations, policy development, and emerging issues
- **Keynote speakers:** National and state-level education leaders
- **Exhibit hall:** Vendors and organizations that serve school districts
- **Business meeting:** OSBA's annual business meeting, where members vote on resolutions, elect leadership, and set legislative priorities for the coming year
- **Regional gatherings:** Informal regional meetups for networking with nearby board members
- **Awards ceremony:** Recognition of outstanding board governance (see below)

#### Value for New Members

For new board members, the convention offers:

- **Immersive learning** — More concentrated education content in two days than you might get in months of individual study
- **Networking** — The chance to meet board members from districts facing similar challenges, plus OSBA staff, ODE officials, and legislators
- **Perspective** — Exposure to how other districts approach governance challenges
- **Energy** — Renewed motivation and commitment to board service

> 💡 **Tip:** Make attending the OSBA convention a priority in your first year. If budget or time is a constraint, discuss with your board chair — most districts budget for convention attendance, and some cover travel and lodging. Plan your session schedule in advance using the convention app or program guide, and prioritize sessions designed for new members.

---

### Board Governance Awards and Recognition

OSBA recognizes outstanding board governance through several awards:

- **OSBA Board of the Year** — Awarded to boards that demonstrate exceptional governance practices, community engagement, and student achievement focus
- **OSBA Board Member of the Year** — Recognizes individual board members who have made outstanding contributions to their districts and the broader education community
- **OSBA All-Oregon School Board** — Recognition for boards that meet criteria for excellence in governance, including participation in training, community engagement, and policy development
- **Regional recognition** — Awards at the regional level for active and effective board members

These awards are presented at the annual convention and recognize both individual excellence and team-based governance effectiveness. Pursuing these awards is not about prestige — the criteria themselves serve as a useful framework for board self-improvement.

---

### OSBA Regions and Regional Meetings — How They Work

OSBA's regional structure is designed to make the association's services accessible and relevant at the local level. Here's how regional engagement works in practice:

1. **Membership in a region** — Your district is automatically assigned to an OSBA region based on geography. Springfield School District falls within a Willamette Valley region.

2. **Regional meetings** — Each region holds meetings 2-4 times per year, typically in the evening at a host district. Meetings feature:
   - Legislative updates from OSBA staff or lobbyists
   - Presentations on timely topics (school safety, budget forecasts, legal changes)
   - Roundtable discussions where boards share challenges and solutions
   - Networking and relationship-building

3. **Regional representatives** — Each region elects a representative to the OSBA board of directors. This representative serves as the liaison between local boards and OSBA's statewide governance.

4. **Resolution process** — Boards can submit resolutions through their region to be considered at the annual convention's business meeting. Resolutions that pass become part of OSBA's legislative platform.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Neglecting regional meetings because they seem "optional." In reality, regional meetings are where some of the most valuable board-to-board learning happens. Hearing how a neighboring district handled a difficult superintendent search, a controversial policy change, or a budget shortfall is practical education that no workshop can fully replicate.

### How to Effectively Use OSBA Resources as a New Board Member

Here is a practical roadmap for maximizing OSBA's value in your first year:

**Month 1 (Immediately after election/appointment):**
- Register for OSBA's new board member orientation
- Request the *Boardsmanship* guide from your superintendent or OSBA
- Log into the OSBA member portal and explore available resources
- Sign up for OSBA e-newsletters and legislative updates
- Access your district's policy manual through OSBA Policy Online (if subscribed)

**Months 2-3:**
- Attend your first regional meeting
- Complete the mandatory public meeting law training through OSBA
- Familiarize yourself with the OSBA legal hotline and when to use it
- Review your district's insurance coverage through PACE/OSBAIT

**Months 4-6:**
- Attend at least one OSBA workshop or webinar on a topic relevant to your board's priorities
- If your board is heading into a bargaining cycle, request OSBA labor relations support
- Connect with experienced board members in your region for informal mentoring

**Months 7-12:**
- Attend the OSBA Annual Convention
- Participate in the resolution process if your board has legislative priorities
- Discuss with your board chair whether to pursue the OSBA Board Self-Assessment
- Consider whether advanced training (Governance Leadership Institute) is appropriate for the following year

> 💡 **Tip:** Designate one board member (or rotate the responsibility) as the "OSBA liaison" who monitors OSBA communications, attends regional meetings consistently, and reports back to the full board. This ensures your board stays connected to OSBA's resources and doesn't miss important updates.

### Membership Costs and What Springfield Currently Utilizes

OSBA membership dues are calculated on a **sliding scale based on district enrollment**, ensuring that small rural districts and large urban districts alike can participate. For a district of Springfield's size (approximately 10,000-11,000 students), annual membership dues are a modest investment relative to the services received — typically in the range of several thousand dollars per year.

Springfield School District currently utilizes the following OSBA services:

- **Full membership** — Access to all core OSBA services
- **Policy Online** — Web-based policy management and update service
- **Legal hotline** — On-demand legal guidance for governance questions
- **Legislative advocacy** — Representation at the state level
- **Training and events** — Access to all OSBA workshops, conferences, and regional meetings
- **PACE insurance** — Property and casualty coverage through the OSBA-sponsored pool
- **Labor relations** — Available for bargaining support as needed
- **Salary survey data** — Access to statewide compensation benchmarking

The cost of OSBA membership is included in the district's general fund budget. Board members do not pay individual dues. The value of OSBA services — particularly policy updates, legal guidance, and legislative advocacy — far exceeds the membership cost. Many of these services, if purchased independently, would cost the district significantly more.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Not using the services you're paying for. OSBA membership gives you access to an extensive suite of tools and support. If your board isn't regularly engaging with OSBA — using Policy Online, calling the legal hotline, attending trainings, participating in advocacy — you are leaving value on the table. Make it a board practice to actively leverage OSBA resources.

### Summary: Why OSBA Matters for Your Board Service

OSBA exists because school board governance is complex, consequential, and constantly evolving. Oregon law changes every legislative session. Court decisions reshape legal obligations. Collective bargaining requires expertise. Community expectations shift. Student needs grow more diverse. No individual board member — and no single district — can keep up with all of this alone.

OSBA provides the infrastructure that makes effective local governance possible at scale. It is your professional association, your policy partner, your legal resource, your training provider, your legislative advocate, and your connection to a statewide network of board members who share your commitment to public education. The most effective board members in Oregon are those who actively engage with OSBA — attending events, using the tools, participating in advocacy, and contributing to the association's work.

As a new board member, your first step is simple: log in, sign up, show up. The resources are there. Use them.
