## Overview

The Oregon School Boards Association (OSBA) is the statewide professional association that serves and supports school board members across Oregon. Founded to strengthen public education governance, OSBA provides a comprehensive suite of services — including policy development, legal guidance, training, and legislative advocacy — that help board members fulfill their responsibilities effectively and in compliance with Oregon law. For a new board member, OSBA is one of the most valuable resources available from day one.

OSBA membership is held at the district level, meaning that when a school district is a member of OSBA, all of its board members automatically have access to the association's full range of services and resources. This includes model policies that districts can adopt and customize, legal consultations on governance questions, and access to a network of experienced board members and education professionals across the state. OSBA also serves as the collective voice for school boards in the Oregon Legislature, advocating for policies and funding that support public education.

One of OSBA's most important functions for new board members is its onboarding and training program. OSBA publishes the *Boardsmanship* guide — a comprehensive handbook for Oregon school board service — and maintains a dedicated resource page for newly elected and appointed members. The association also hosts regional training events and an annual convention that bring board members together for professional development, networking, and policy discussions. Since January 1, 2024, OSBA has been a primary provider of the state-mandated public meeting law training that all Oregon elected officials must complete each term, making it a critical partner in meeting legal obligations.

## Key Concepts

### OSBA Mission and Funding Model

OSBA's mission is to advance excellence in public education by supporting and strengthening local school boards. The association operates as a membership-funded nonprofit, with dues paid by member districts based on district size and enrollment. This funding model ensures that OSBA's services are responsive to the needs of its members — the school boards themselves — rather than to external funders or political interests. OSBA's independence and focus on board governance make it a trusted resource for board members seeking guidance on everything from routine policy questions to complex legal and legislative issues.

### Member Services: Training, Policy, Legal, and Advocacy

OSBA offers four core service areas that board members should be aware of. First, the training program provides orientation for new members, ongoing professional development workshops, and the annual convention. Second, the policy services team maintains a comprehensive library of model policies aligned with Oregon law and OARs, which districts can adopt or adapt as needed. Third, OSBA offers legal guidance to help boards navigate governance questions, employment matters, and compliance issues — though this guidance is advisory and does not replace the district's own legal counsel. Fourth, OSBA's advocacy team monitors and influences legislation at the state level, ensuring that the perspectives of local school boards are represented in the policymaking process.

### New Board Member Resources and the Boardsmanship Guide

OSBA recognizes that the transition into board service can be overwhelming, particularly for members appointed to fill mid-term vacancies who may have less preparation time. To address this, OSBA maintains a dedicated new board member resource page that includes orientation checklists, key documents, recommended reading, and links to essential state resources. The *Boardsmanship* guide is OSBA's flagship publication for board members, covering topics such as board roles and responsibilities, effective meeting practices, policy governance, superintendent evaluation, and ethics. New members are strongly encouraged to read this guide early in their tenure and to refer to it as a practical reference throughout their service.

### Annual Conference and Regional Training Events

OSBA's annual convention is the largest gathering of school board members in Oregon and provides a concentrated opportunity for learning, networking, and policy engagement. Sessions cover a wide range of topics — from school finance and legal updates to equity, community engagement, and board leadership. In addition to the annual convention, OSBA hosts regional training events throughout the year, making professional development accessible to board members across the state. Attendance at these events is an investment in governance quality and helps board members stay current on legal changes, best practices, and emerging issues in Oregon public education.

### OSBA's Role in Public Meeting Law Training Delivery

Since the enactment of mandatory public meeting law training for all Oregon elected officials (effective January 1, 2024), OSBA has served as one of the primary providers of this training for school board members. The training covers the requirements of Oregon's Public Meeting Law, including open meeting rules, notice requirements, executive session procedures, and the consequences of non-compliance. Board members must complete this training each term, and OSBA offers both in-person and online options to meet the requirement. Completing this training promptly upon taking office is both a legal obligation and a practical step toward effective, transparent governance.
