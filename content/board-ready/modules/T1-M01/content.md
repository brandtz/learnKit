## Overview

Serving on a school board is one of the most consequential forms of public service in local government. School board members are elected by their communities to set the strategic direction for the district, adopt policies that shape the educational experience of every student, and ensure responsible stewardship of public funds. Understanding the scope and boundaries of this role is the essential first step for any new — or experienced — board member.

The single most important distinction a board member must internalize is the line between **governance** and **management**. The board governs: it sets vision, adopts policy, approves budgets, and hires and evaluates the superintendent. The superintendent manages: they run the day-to-day operations of the district, hire and supervise staff, and implement the policies the board has adopted. When board members cross into management — directing staff, intervening in operational decisions, or micromanaging programs — the governance structure breaks down, trust erodes, and the district suffers.

Oregon law is explicit about how board authority works. Under ORS Chapter 332, a school board is a corporate body. Authority resides in the board as a whole, acting in properly noticed public meetings. No individual board member — including the chair — has independent authority to act on behalf of the district, direct employees, or make commitments. This principle protects the democratic process and ensures that decisions reflect the collective judgment of elected representatives, not the preferences of any single individual.

Finally, every board member holds a **fiduciary duty** to the public. This means acting in the best interest of students and the community, exercising care and diligence in financial oversight, and avoiding conflicts of interest. The public places enormous trust in its elected board members, and that trust must be honored in every vote, every conversation, and every decision.

## Key Concepts

### Board-Superintendent Relationship: Governance vs. Management

The governance-management distinction is the bedrock of effective board service. The board's job is to ask "what" and "why" — What should our students achieve? Why are we allocating resources this way? The superintendent's job is to answer "how" — How will we implement this policy? How will we staff this program? When a board member begins telling the superintendent or staff *how* to do their jobs, they have crossed from governance into management. This blurring of roles is consistently identified by the Oregon School Boards Association as the single most common governance failure in school districts. Effective boards maintain this boundary through clear role descriptions, regular self-evaluation, and a strong working relationship with the superintendent built on mutual respect and defined expectations.

### Fiduciary Duty and Public Trust

Board members are entrusted with public resources — taxpayer dollars, public facilities, and the education of children. Fiduciary duty requires that every decision be made in the interest of students and the broader community, not for personal benefit, political advantage, or the preferences of any particular constituency. This duty encompasses financial oversight (ensuring the budget is sound and expenditures are appropriate), legal compliance (ensuring the district follows state and federal law), and ethical conduct (avoiding conflicts of interest and maintaining transparency). A board member who votes based on personal relationships, business interests, or political pressure — rather than what is best for students — has violated this trust.

### Individual Authority vs. Board Authority

One of the most frequently misunderstood aspects of board service is the scope of an individual member's authority. Outside of a properly convened meeting, an individual board member has no more authority over the school district than any other citizen. A board member cannot direct the superintendent to take action, cannot instruct a principal to change a decision, and cannot commit the district to any obligation. All authority flows from the board acting as a collective body in a public meeting. This principle is not merely procedural — it is a safeguard of democratic governance. It ensures that the community's elected representatives deliberate together, hear public input, and make decisions transparently.

### Nine Principles of a Successful Board Member (OSBA)

The Oregon School Boards Association identifies nine principles that define effective board service. These include keeping the focus on student achievement, working as a governance team, maintaining ethical standards, delegating authority to the superintendent, taking collective responsibility for board performance, and engaging the community. These principles provide a practical framework for new board members to evaluate their own conduct and for boards to hold themselves accountable. They are not aspirational ideals — they are the operational standards that distinguish high-functioning boards from those mired in dysfunction.
