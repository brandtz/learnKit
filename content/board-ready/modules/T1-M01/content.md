## Overview

Serving on a school board is one of the most consequential forms of public service in Oregon. School board members collectively govern institutions that shape the futures of thousands of children, manage multi-million-dollar budgets, and employ hundreds of professionals. Yet most new board members arrive with little formal preparation for the role. This module provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding what a school board member does, what authority they hold, and how to be effective from day one.

Understanding your role is not merely academic — misunderstanding it is the single most common source of board dysfunction, superintendent turnover, and community frustration. The distinction between governance and management, the limits of individual authority, and the obligations of public trust form the bedrock of effective board service.

Oregon school districts are governed by locally elected boards operating under ORS Chapter 332. These boards are corporate bodies with enumerated powers — they can only do what state law authorizes. Within that framework, however, their authority is enormous: they set tax rates, approve budgets exceeding tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, adopt policies affecting thousands of students and families, and serve as the employer of record for every district employee. This module will help you understand the full scope of that authority and — just as importantly — its limits.

### The Board-Superintendent Relationship: Governance vs. Management

The most critical concept for any new board member to internalize is the distinction between **governance** and **management**. The board governs; the superintendent manages. This sounds simple, but in practice the line can be maddeningly difficult to see — and crossing it is the most common mistake new board members make.

**Governance** means:
- Setting the vision, mission, and strategic direction of the district
- Adopting policies that guide how the district operates
- Hiring, evaluating, and (if necessary) terminating the superintendent
- Approving the annual budget and major expenditures
- Serving as a court of final appeal for staff and community grievances
- Representing the community's values and priorities to the administration

**Management** means:
- Implementing board policies through day-to-day operations
- Hiring, supervising, and evaluating all staff other than the superintendent
- Making curriculum and instructional decisions within board policy
- Managing facilities, transportation, food service, and other operations
- Handling individual student discipline cases (unless appealed to the board)
- Communicating with media on operational matters

#### Concrete Examples of Crossing the Line

| Governance (Board's Role) | Management (Superintendent's Role) | Crossing the Line |
|---|---|---|
| Adopting a policy requiring competitive bidding for contracts over $150,000 | Selecting the winning vendor for a roofing project | A board member calling the facilities director to advocate for a specific contractor |
| Approving the annual budget with staffing allocations | Deciding which teacher is assigned to which grade level | A board member telling the principal that Mrs. Johnson should teach 4th grade |
| Setting a strategic goal to improve graduation rates by 5% | Designing intervention programs and selecting curricula | A board member insisting the district adopt a specific reading program they saw at a conference |
| Evaluating the superintendent annually against agreed-upon goals | Evaluating principals and other administrators | A board member telling a principal they are "not doing a good job" based on a parent complaint |
| Adopting a student discipline policy framework | Handling an individual student's suspension | A board member calling the school to intervene in their neighbor's child's discipline case |
| Approving a bond measure for new construction | Managing the construction project timeline and contractors | A board member visiting the construction site to give direction to the project manager |

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** New board members who previously served on school site councils, PTOs, or booster clubs often arrive accustomed to being involved in operational decisions. The shift to a governance-only role can feel frustrating — like you have been given less power, not more. In reality, governance power is enormous, but it operates at a different level. You shape the *system*; the superintendent runs it.

#### Building a Productive Relationship with the Superintendent

The board-superintendent relationship is often compared to a corporate board of directors and CEO, but it has unique features in public education:

- **One employee, one boss:** The superintendent's only boss is the board *as a body*. Individual board members are not the superintendent's boss. When a board member gives direct instructions to the superintendent, it creates confusion about whose direction the superintendent should follow.
- **No surprises rule:** The superintendent should keep the board informed of significant issues before they become public. Equally, the board should not surprise the superintendent with new agenda items, public criticism, or media statements without prior discussion.
- **Chain of command:** Board members should direct questions and requests through the superintendent, not directly to staff. This does not mean you cannot be friendly with teachers and principals — but official requests for information or action go through the superintendent's office.
- **Unified front:** After the board makes a decision by vote, all members should support it publicly, even if they voted against it. This is one of the hardest disciplines of board service, but it is essential for organizational stability.
- **Evaluation as the cornerstone:** The superintendent evaluation is the board's single most powerful management tool. A well-structured annual evaluation with clear, measurable goals gives the superintendent direction and gives the board accountability.

> **💡 Tip:** Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your superintendent within your first two weeks. Ask about their communication preferences, how they like to receive questions, what the current top priorities and challenges are, and what they need most from the board. This conversation sets the tone for your entire working relationship.

#### When the Relationship Breaks Down

Research from the Broad Center and AASA (American Association of School Administrators) shows that the average superintendent tenure in the United States is approximately 3–4 years, and that the number one reason superintendents leave is a dysfunctional relationship with the board. In Oregon, OSBA regularly mediates board-superintendent conflicts. Warning signs include:

- Board members routinely contacting staff directly instead of going through the superintendent
- The superintendent feeling they must "manage" individual board members rather than the district
- Board meetings dominated by micromanagement questions about operational details
- Public disagreements between board members and the superintendent
- A superintendent who stops sharing difficult news with the board for fear of the reaction

If you notice these patterns, raise the issue with the board chair and consider requesting facilitated governance training from OSBA.

### Fiduciary Duty and Public Trust

As a school board member, you are a **fiduciary** — someone entrusted with the responsibility to act in the best interest of others. In this case, "others" means the students, families, staff, and taxpayers of your district. This is not a metaphor; it is a legal obligation with real consequences.

#### Three Components of Fiduciary Duty

1. **Duty of Care:** You must make informed decisions. This means reading board packets (which can run hundreds of pages), attending meetings and work sessions, asking questions, and staying current on district issues. You cannot simply vote based on a colleague's recommendation without doing your own homework. Courts have held that board members who fail to inform themselves before voting have breached their duty of care.

2. **Duty of Loyalty:** You must put the interests of the district above your personal interests, the interests of your friends, your political allies, or any special interest group. If you have a financial or personal interest in a matter before the board, you must disclose it and may need to recuse yourself (covered in depth in Module T1-M05).

3. **Duty of Obedience:** You must ensure the district operates within the law and within its own policies. If you become aware that the district is violating a law or policy, you have an obligation to raise the issue with the board and superintendent. Turning a blind eye to known violations can create personal liability.

#### Real Examples of Fiduciary Breaches

- A board member in a rural Oregon district voted to approve a construction contract with a company owned by their brother-in-law without disclosing the relationship. The Oregon Government Ethics Commission investigated and imposed a civil penalty. The contract was also challenged and had to be rebid, costing the district months of delay.
- A board member routinely missed meetings and never read board packets, but cast votes based on how another member voted. While not an ethics violation per se, this represents a failure of the duty of care that erodes public trust and exposes the district to risk if those votes are ever challenged.
- A board in Southern Oregon adopted a student assessment policy that directly contradicted state law. The board's failure to ensure legal compliance (duty of obedience) exposed the district to potential loss of state funding and legal liability.
- A board member used their position to pressure the superintendent to hire a family friend for a coaching position. Even though the hire ultimately went to a different candidate, the attempt to use public office for private benefit was itself a violation of the duty of loyalty.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Some board members believe their role is to represent only the people who voted for them, or only the parents in their zone. Your fiduciary duty is to *all* students and *all* taxpayers in the district, including those who did not vote for you, those who do not have children in the schools, and those whose views differ from yours.

### Individual Authority vs. Board Authority: ORS 332.045

This is perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of school board service, and Oregon law is explicit about it.

#### What the Law Says

Under **ORS 332.045**, an individual school board member has **no authority** to act on behalf of the district unless the board as a body has specifically delegated that authority by formal vote. This means you cannot:

- Direct staff to take any action
- Commit district resources or make financial promises
- Represent your personal opinion as the board's position
- Conduct investigations into staff or student matters
- Negotiate on behalf of the district
- Access confidential student or personnel records beyond what is shared with the full board

**What this means in practice:**

- When a parent approaches you at the grocery store to complain about a teacher, you can listen empathetically, but you cannot promise action or call the school to intervene. You should direct them to the principal or superintendent's office.
- When a reporter asks you about a controversial district decision, you should refer them to the board chair or superintendent unless the board has designated you as a spokesperson.
- When a community member asks you to place an item on the board agenda, you should follow the board's established process for agenda-setting (typically a request through the board chair and superintendent).
- When you receive an email from a concerned parent with detailed complaints about a specific teacher, you should forward it to the superintendent — not investigate it yourself.

#### The Power of the Body

The board acts only when it is in a properly noticed public meeting with a quorum present and takes a formal vote. Decisions made over email, in parking lot conversations, phone trees, or at dinner parties are not board actions — and can actually violate Oregon's public meetings law (ORS 192.610–192.690). Even informal polling of board members outside of a meeting — "How would you vote on this?" — can constitute a violation if a quorum is involved.

| Individual Board Member CAN: | Individual Board Member CANNOT: |
|---|---|
| Attend community events and listen to concerns | Direct staff to take specific actions |
| Ask the superintendent for information | Commit district resources or make promises |
| Propose agenda items through proper channels | Speak as "the board" without authorization |
| Vote on motions during public meetings | Make decisions outside of public meetings |
| Share their personal opinion (clearly labeled as such) | Conduct investigations or personnel reviews |
| Attend school events to show support | Enter schools to evaluate or supervise staff |
| Request data or reports through the superintendent | Access confidential records independently |

> **💡 Tip:** Practice this phrase: *"Thank you for sharing that with me. I do not have the authority to act on this individually, but I will make sure this concern gets to the right person. You can also contact the superintendent's office directly at..."* This acknowledges the concern, demonstrates your understanding of your role, and provides a constructive path forward.

### The Nine OSBA Principles of Effective Board Service

The Oregon School Boards Association (OSBA) has articulated nine principles that define effective board service. These principles are not merely aspirational — they form the framework for OSBA's board self-evaluation tools and professional development programs.

#### 1. Focus on Student Achievement
Everything the board does should ultimately connect back to improving outcomes for students. Budget decisions, policy changes, strategic planning, and personnel actions should all be evaluated through the lens of student impact. When debating a budget line item, the question is not just "Can we afford it?" but "How does this investment serve students?" High-performing boards spend the majority of their meeting time on issues directly connected to teaching and learning.

#### 2. Govern Through Policy
The board's primary tool is policy. Rather than making case-by-case operational decisions, effective boards establish clear policies that guide the superintendent and staff. When an issue arises, the first question should be: *"What does our policy say?"* If the policy is inadequate, the board's job is to fix the policy — not to manage around it. Policy governance provides consistency, predictability, and fairness.

#### 3. Employ, Support, and Evaluate the Superintendent
The superintendent is the board's only direct employee. The board should invest significant time in hiring the right person, providing clear expectations through a detailed job description and annual goals, offering ongoing support and feedback, and conducting a rigorous annual evaluation tied to district goals. A strong superintendent evaluation process is the single best tool the board has for driving district performance.

#### 4. Delegate Authority to the Superintendent
Once you have hired a superintendent, let them do the job. Effective boards resist the temptation to micromanage. They set clear expectations through policy and the superintendent's evaluation, then trust the superintendent to deliver results. Delegation does not mean abdication — the board still monitors performance — but it means respecting the superintendent's professional expertise and operational authority.

#### 5. Communicate and Engage with the Community
Board members are the community's elected representatives. You should be visible at school events, accessible to constituents, and proactive in sharing information about board decisions. Effective communication builds trust and helps the board understand community priorities. This means not just talking to the public, but listening — through community forums, surveys, school visits, and one-on-one conversations.

#### 6. Make Decisions Through Board Process
No decisions in hallways, parking lots, phone trees, or email chains. Every decision the board makes should happen in a properly noticed public meeting following established procedures. This protects the board legally and maintains public trust. It also ensures that all board members have equal access to information and equal voice in the decision.

#### 7. Act in an Ethical and Professional Manner
Board members must adhere to Oregon ethics laws, maintain confidentiality when required, treat colleagues and staff with respect, and avoid conflicts of interest. Your conduct reflects not just on you, but on the entire board and district. Ethical lapses by one member damage the credibility of the whole board.

#### 8. Commit to Professional Development
Effective board members never stop learning. OSBA offers conferences, workshops, webinars, and publications. Oregon law requires annual training on specific topics including ethics and public meetings. The best board members actively seek out learning opportunities and bring new knowledge back to the board. Attending OSBA's annual convention and summer board conference should be priorities.

#### 9. Lead as a Governance Team
The board functions as a team, not as seven (or five) individual actors. This means supporting the majority's decision even when you voted against it, working through disagreements respectfully, and presenting a unified face to the community. It also means participating in board self-evaluation, team-building, and governance training together as a group.

> **💡 Tip:** Print these nine principles and keep them where you will see them before every board meeting. Before voting on any item, ask yourself: *"Which of these principles am I serving with this vote?"*

### Your First 90 Days: A Roadmap for New Board Members

The first three months of your board service set the trajectory for your entire term. Research on effective governance consistently shows that board members who invest in learning and relationship-building early are more effective throughout their service. Here is a structured approach:

#### Week 1–2: Orientation
- Meet one-on-one with the superintendent and each cabinet-level administrator
- Receive and begin reading the board policy manual (focus on Sections B, C, D, and G first)
- Review the current strategic plan, annual budget, and most recent audit
- Get access to the board portal, email, and any document management systems
- Obtain copies of current collective bargaining agreements
- Review the most recent board self-evaluation results
- Read the last six months of board meeting minutes and packets
- Confirm your compliance obligations: ethics training, financial disclosure (SEI), oath of office

#### Week 3–4: Observation and Learning
- Attend your first board meeting primarily as an observer — listen more than you speak
- Tour at least three to five schools in the district, including elementary, middle, and high school levels
- Meet with the OSBA regional representative and discuss available training
- Begin the OSBA New Board Member training series (available online and in person)
- Review the district's most recent audit report, enrollment trends, and assessment data
- Read your district's student handbook and employee handbook

#### Month 2: Building Relationships
- Attend a school event (concert, sports event, open house, or career fair)
- Meet with employee association leaders (teachers' union president, classified union president)
- Have coffee or lunch with each fellow board member individually — ask about their priorities, concerns, and advice
- Attend a PTO or site council meeting at a school in your area
- Review current year enrollment data, demographic trends, and boundary maps
- Begin attending any standing board committee meetings

#### Month 3: Full Engagement
- Participate fully in board discussions, asking informed questions
- Identify one or two policy areas you would like to learn more deeply
- Attend an OSBA workshop, webinar, or regional event
- Begin developing questions about the upcoming budget process
- Participate in any board goal-setting or strategic planning sessions
- Schedule a check-in with the superintendent to discuss how onboarding is going

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Many new board members feel pressure to "make their mark" immediately by proposing major changes or challenging established practices. Resist this urge. Spend your first 90 days learning the district, building relationships, and understanding the context. The most effective board members are the ones who listen first and act thoughtfully. You will have years to influence the district — but you only get one chance to make a good first impression with your colleagues and the community.

### Common Mistakes New Board Members Make

Based on decades of OSBA experience, national governance research, and input from experienced Oregon superintendents, here are the most frequent pitfalls:

1. **Trying to be the superintendent.** You were elected to govern, not to manage. When you find yourself thinking about how to solve an operational problem, redirect yourself to the policy question behind it.

2. **Representing a single constituency.** Whether you ran to "fix" a specific school, represent a geographic area, or champion a particular cause, your legal duty is to the entire district. Advocacy for a cause is fine; tunnel vision is not.

3. **Making promises you cannot keep.** You are one vote on a multi-member body. Never promise a constituent that you *will* do something — promise that you will *raise the issue* and advocate for it.

4. **Violating the chain of command.** Going directly to a teacher, principal, or other staff member to give direction or investigate an issue undermines the superintendent and can create legal problems, especially in personnel matters.

5. **Conducting board business outside meetings.** If a quorum of board members discusses board business via email, text, phone, or social media, it may constitute a violation of Oregon's public meetings law. Be especially careful with "reply all" email chains.

6. **Failing to maintain confidentiality.** What is discussed in executive session stays in executive session. Violating this can expose you personally to legal liability and destroy trust among your colleagues.

7. **Not reading the board packet.** Board packets can run hundreds of pages. Read them anyway. Ask questions of the superintendent before the meeting so meeting time can be used efficiently. Arriving unprepared wastes everyone's time.

8. **Taking criticism personally.** The public has a right to criticize their elected officials. Learning to hear criticism without becoming defensive is essential for longevity in public service. Not every complaint requires a response; not every angry email deserves an equally emotional reply.

9. **Freelancing with the media or on social media.** Speaking to reporters or posting on social media about board business without coordinating with the board chair can create confusion and undermine the board's ability to speak with one voice.

10. **Ignoring professional development.** Board service has a learning curve. Members who skip OSBA training, refuse to participate in board retreats, or dismiss governance best practices as unnecessary bureaucracy tend to be the ones who cause the most dysfunction.

### The Board's Role in Strategic Planning vs. Operational Decisions

One of the board's most important functions is strategic planning — setting the long-term direction for the district. But understanding the boundary between strategic and operational decisions is crucial.

**The board's strategic role includes:**
- Engaging the community to establish a shared vision for the district
- Adopting a 3–5 year strategic plan with specific, measurable goals
- Setting annual board priorities that align with the strategic plan
- Monitoring progress toward strategic goals through regular data reports
- Adjusting the strategic direction based on outcomes and community input
- Ensuring the annual budget aligns with strategic priorities

**Operational decisions that belong to the superintendent include:**
- How to implement the strategic plan in individual schools
- Which programs, curricula, and instructional strategies to use
- How to allocate staff across buildings and programs
- Day-to-day scheduling, logistics, and crisis management
- Individual student and personnel matters
- Vendor selection and contract management within board-approved budgets

#### The Strategic Planning Cycle

| Phase | Board's Role | Superintendent's Role |
|---|---|---|
| Vision Setting | Lead community engagement to establish values and long-term vision | Provide data on current performance, trends, and comparisons |
| Goal Development | Adopt specific, measurable strategic goals | Recommend goals based on data, research, and best practice |
| Implementation | Monitor progress through regular reports at board meetings | Design and execute action plans, allocate resources |
| Evaluation | Review annual outcomes against goals; ask hard questions | Compile data, analyze results, recommend adjustments |
| Revision | Decide whether to adjust strategic direction | Propose modifications based on results and changing conditions |

> **💡 Tip:** At every board meeting, connect at least one agenda item back to a specific strategic plan goal. This keeps the strategic plan alive and prevents it from becoming a document that sits on a shelf. Ask the superintendent to include a "strategic plan alignment" note on each action item in the board packet.

---

### Interacting with Staff, Parents, and Media

How board members interact with stakeholders can build or destroy trust. Clear boundaries and consistent practices are essential.

#### With District Staff
- Be friendly and approachable, but remember you are not their supervisor
- Do not give direction, make promises, or imply you will intervene on their behalf
- If a staff member raises a concern with you, direct them to their supervisor or the superintendent
- Never discuss personnel matters outside of executive session — even to your spouse
- Attend school events to show support, not to evaluate or supervise
- Thank staff publicly when appropriate; it costs nothing and means everything

#### With Parents and Community Members
- Listen actively and empathetically to concerns; sometimes people just need to be heard
- Explain the process: "Here is how the board handles issues like this..."
- Direct them to the appropriate staff member for operational issues
- Be honest about what you can and cannot do as an individual board member
- Follow up with the superintendent to ensure the concern was addressed
- Never discuss other families' children or share confidential information

#### With Media
- Unless the board has designated you as a spokesperson, refer media inquiries to the board chair or superintendent
- If you do speak to media, clearly distinguish between your personal opinion and the board's official position
- Never discuss executive session content, personnel matters, or confidential student information
- Assume everything you say will be quoted — because it will be
- Social media posts are public statements; treat them with the same caution as talking to a reporter
- If a reporter calls about a crisis or breaking news, the correct response is: "I would direct you to the superintendent's office for comment on that."

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board member posts on their personal Facebook page: *"I can't believe the superintendent wants to close Lincoln Elementary. I am going to fight this."* This undermines the board process, publicly opposes the superintendent before the board has discussed the issue, and may prejudice the community before the full analysis is presented. A better approach: *"I have been hearing community concerns about the enrollment study. I want everyone to know the board will carefully consider all options at our upcoming meeting. Your input matters — here is how to participate..."*

### Board Member Liability and Immunity Under Oregon Law

Understanding your legal exposure as a board member is important for both your peace of mind and your decision-making.

#### Conditional Immunity Under ORS 30.265

Oregon provides **conditional immunity** to public officials acting within the scope of their duties. Under ORS 30.265 (the Oregon Tort Claims Act), board members are generally immune from personal liability for decisions made in their official capacity, *as long as* they act:

- Within the scope of their authority as defined by statute and board policy
- Without malice or intent to harm
- In good faith based on the information available at the time

This means that if you vote to close a school, restructure a program, or deny an appeal, and a community member sues, you are personally protected as long as you followed proper process and acted in good faith — even if the decision turns out poorly.

#### When Immunity Does NOT Apply

Immunity has important exceptions. You may be personally exposed when:

- Acting outside the scope of your authority (e.g., directing staff without board authorization in violation of ORS 332.045)
- Acting with malice, fraud, or intent to harm
- Violating someone's civil rights (federal Section 1983 claims can pierce state immunity)
- Violating Oregon Government Ethics laws (OGEC can impose personal civil penalties up to $5,000 per violation)
- Engaging in criminal conduct
- Breaching confidentiality of executive session discussions
- Committing defamation with actual malice

#### District Indemnification and D&O Insurance

Most Oregon school districts carry Directors & Officers (D&O) liability insurance and have policies providing legal defense and indemnification to board members acting in their official capacity. Within your first month, you should:

- Confirm with the superintendent that the district carries D&O insurance
- Understand the coverage limits and any exclusions
- Review the district's board member indemnification policy
- Ask whether the insurance covers legal costs from OGEC complaints

#### Reducing Your Legal Risk

- Always act within your authority as defined by ORS 332.045
- Follow board policies and procedures in every decision
- Make decisions based on evidence, data, and proper process
- Maintain strict confidentiality of executive session content
- Disclose conflicts of interest promptly and completely
- Document your reasoning for important or controversial votes
- Attend ethics and public meetings law training annually
- When in doubt, ask the board to consult legal counsel before acting

> **💡 Tip:** Ask the superintendent to schedule a session with the district's legal counsel within your first month. Understanding the legal framework early — including liability protections, public meetings law, public records obligations, and ethics requirements — can prevent costly mistakes later. A one-hour conversation with the district attorney is worth more than a hundred hours of worrying.

### Key Takeaways

- The board governs; the superintendent manages. Maintaining this boundary is the foundation of effective board service and the key to superintendent retention.
- You have no individual authority under ORS 332.045. The board acts only as a body in properly noticed public meetings.
- Your fiduciary duty (care, loyalty, and obedience) is to *all* students and *all* taxpayers — not just those who elected you.
- The nine OSBA principles provide a roadmap for effective service; use them as a regular self-assessment tool.
- Your first 90 days should be spent learning, listening, and building relationships — not pushing an agenda.
- Board members enjoy conditional immunity under Oregon law, but that immunity has real limits.
- When in doubt, ask: *"Is this a governance question or a management question?"*

### Knowledge Check Preparation

As you prepare for the knowledge check, make sure you can:

- Explain the difference between governance and management with specific examples of what crosses the line
- Describe the three components of fiduciary duty and give a real-world example of each
- State what ORS 332.045 says about individual board member authority and why it matters
- List and explain all nine OSBA principles of effective board service
- Identify at least five common mistakes new board members make and how to avoid them
