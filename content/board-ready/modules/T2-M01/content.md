## Overview

ORS Chapter 332 is the single most important statute for any Oregon school board member to understand. Titled "Local Administration of Education," it is the legal backbone that creates school boards, defines their composition, enumerates their powers and duties, establishes how vacancies are filled, and governs the board's relationship with its superintendent, its employees, and the public. If you serve on an Oregon school board, virtually everything you do in your official capacity traces back to ORS Chapter 332.

Unlike general-purpose local government bodies (cities, counties), Oregon school districts derive their authority exclusively from state statute. Oregon follows what is sometimes called "Dillon's Rule" — the principle that a political subdivision possesses only those powers expressly granted by the Legislature, those necessarily implied from an express grant, and those essential to the declared purposes of the entity. For school boards, this means that if ORS Chapter 332 (or another relevant statute) does not authorize a particular action, the board almost certainly lacks the legal power to take it. This is not a technicality. Board actions taken without statutory authority are *ultra vires* — beyond the law — and can be voided by a court, expose the district to liability, and erode public confidence in governance.

Chapter 332 is organized roughly along functional lines. The opening sections address definitions, board composition, and elections. Subsequent sections cover vacancies, board powers, board duties, the superintendent relationship, meetings, and specialized topics such as transportation, school calendars, and real property. For a new board member, the chapter can feel dense and legalistic, but mastering its key provisions is essential to understanding what you can do, what you must do, and what you cannot do.

This module walks through the most important provisions of ORS Chapter 332, explains how they work in practice, and provides scenarios and examples that illustrate the day-to-day relevance of the statute to board governance.

### Structure of ORS Chapter 332

ORS Chapter 332 contains more than 100 individual sections spanning topics from board elections to transportation safety. Understanding the chapter's overall organization will help you locate relevant provisions quickly and see how different sections connect.

| Section Range | Subject Area |
|---|---|
| 332.002–332.003 | Definitions and applicability |
| 332.005–332.018 | Board composition, elections, zone plans |
| 332.020–332.030 | Terms of office, oath, vacancies |
| 332.035–332.045 | Organization, quorum, powers |
| 332.055–332.075 | Board duties, meetings, minutes |
| 332.107–332.114 | Superintendent — hiring, duties, evaluation |
| 332.155–332.172 | School year, calendar, transportation |
| 332.176–332.208 | Property, contracts, budget authority |
| 332.405–332.435 | Intergovernmental agreements, ESD relationships |

This layout reflects a deliberate structure: the statute moves from *who is on the board* to *how the board operates* to *what the board can do* to *how the board relates to other entities*. When you encounter a governance question, think about which functional area it falls into, and you can usually narrow down the relevant section range.

### ORS 332.002 — Definitions

Every statute begins with definitions, and Chapter 332 is no exception. ORS 332.002 defines terms that appear throughout the chapter, including "district school board," "school district," and "resident." While these definitions may seem obvious, they carry precise legal meanings that matter in disputed situations.

For example, the term "resident" is critical in election law, boundary disputes, and student enrollment questions. A person's legal residence determines which district they vote in, which board they may run for, and — under separate statutes — which district is responsible for educating their children. Board members should be careful not to assume that "residence" always means the same thing in common conversation as it does in statute.

> **💡 Tip:** Whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term in ORS 332, check ORS 332.002 first. If it is not defined there, check the general definitions in ORS 174.100–174.109. Using statutory definitions consistently will keep your board discussions legally precise.

### ORS 332.005 — Board Composition: 5 vs. 7 Members

ORS 332.005 establishes that every Oregon school district is governed by a board of directors. The default size is **five members**, but the statute permits a district to increase to **seven members** through a process defined in ORS 332.005(2). The choice between five and seven members is consequential — it affects quorum requirements, committee structures, and the practical dynamics of governance.

**Five-member board:**
- Quorum = 3 members
- A single absence makes it harder to achieve quorum
- Easier to achieve consensus; tighter deliberation
- Most common configuration among Oregon districts

**Seven-member board:**
- Quorum = 4 members
- Greater resilience against absences
- More diverse representation, particularly in larger districts
- Can create more robust committee structures

**How to change board size:**
Under ORS 332.005(2), a school board may submit the question of increasing board size to the voters at a regular district election. If approved by voters, the two additional positions are phased in at the next two regular elections (one seat each cycle) to maintain staggered terms. Reducing from seven back to five follows a similar voter-approval process.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** A board cannot simply pass a resolution to add two members. Changing board size requires a vote of the electorate. Any attempt to unilaterally change board size would be ultra vires.

---

### ORS 332.018 — Zone Elections vs. At-Large Elections

ORS 332.018 governs how districts may move from at-large elections (all voters vote for all seats) to zone-based elections (each seat represents a geographic sub-area of the district). Zone elections are a tool for ensuring that different communities within a large district have dedicated representation on the board.

**At-large elections** mean every registered voter in the district votes on every board seat. This is the default and is most common in smaller, geographically compact districts.

**Zone elections** divide the district into geographic zones, each represented by one board member. Only voters residing in a zone vote for that zone's board seat. The board member must also reside within the zone.

**Key provisions of ORS 332.018:**
- A board may adopt a zone election plan by resolution after a public hearing
- Zone plans must divide the district into zones that are substantially equal in population
- Zone plans must comply with the federal Voting Rights Act
- A zone plan may be challenged by petition and referred to the voters
- The board may retain one or two at-large positions even under a zone plan

**When zones matter:**
Zone elections are most commonly used in larger districts — particularly those spanning urban and rural areas, or districts with significant demographic diversity — where at-large elections might result in all board members coming from a single area or community. The 2021 amendments to redistricting requirements (following the Census) increased attention to equitable zone plans.

| Factor | At-Large | Zone-Based |
|---|---|---|
| Voter pool | All district voters for all seats | Only zone residents for zone seat |
| Residency | Anywhere in district | Must live in zone |
| Representation | Broad, district-wide focus | Neighborhood-level representation |
| Complexity | Simple | Requires mapping, population analysis |
| Common in | Small/mid-size districts | Large districts, districts with diversity concerns |

> **💡 Tip:** If your district is considering zone elections, consult with legal counsel early. Zone plans must satisfy both state law (ORS 332.018) and federal requirements (Voting Rights Act, Equal Protection). A poorly drawn zone plan can trigger litigation.

### ORS 332.030 — Vacancies: Filling Empty Seats

Vacancies are one of the most procedurally sensitive areas of school board law. ORS 332.030 defines when a vacancy exists and establishes the timeline and process for filling it.

**A vacancy occurs when a board member:**
- Dies
- Resigns (effective upon the date specified, or upon acceptance by the board)
- Is removed from office
- Ceases to be a resident of the district (or zone, if applicable)
- Is convicted of a felony
- Fails to attend meetings for a defined period without board-excused absence
- Ceases to discharge the duties of office for any other reason specified in statute

**The appointment process:**

1. The remaining board members must fill the vacancy by **appointment** within a defined timeframe.
2. Under ORS 332.030, the board has **30 days** from the date the vacancy occurs to appoint a replacement. If the board fails to act within 30 days, the authority to appoint transfers to the county education service district (ESD) board.
3. The appointed member serves until **June 30 following the next regular school board election** at which a successor can be elected.
4. If the vacancy occurs close to an election, the appointed member may serve only a brief period before the elected successor takes office.

**Special elections:** In some circumstances — particularly when a vacancy occurs early in a term — a special election may be called to fill the seat. The board may request the county elections officer to include the vacancy on an upcoming ballot.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Boards sometimes delay the vacancy appointment process, hoping to find the "perfect" candidate. If you miss the 30-day window, your appointment authority transfers to the ESD — and you lose control over who joins your board. Treat the 30-day deadline as firm.

**Practical scenario:**

*Board Member Martinez resigns effective March 15. The board has until April 14 to appoint a replacement. The board solicits applications, interviews candidates at a public meeting on April 5, and appoints a replacement on April 7. The appointed member takes the oath and is seated at the next regular meeting. The appointed member will serve until June 30 following the next May school board election.*

### ORS 332.045 — Powers of the Board

ORS 332.045 is the **central grant of authority** for Oregon school boards. It enumerates the powers the board possesses, and — under Dillon's Rule — these enumerated powers, together with those reasonably implied, define the outer boundary of what the board can lawfully do.

**Key powers under ORS 332.045 include:**

- **Policy adoption:** The board may adopt policies for the governance of the district, provided they do not conflict with state or federal law.
- **Personnel:** The board has the authority to employ (and terminate) a superintendent and to approve personnel actions recommended by the superintendent.
- **Property:** The board may acquire, hold, sell, or lease real property for district purposes, subject to statutory limitations on disposal of public property.
- **Contracts:** The board may enter into contracts for goods, services, and construction, subject to Oregon public contracting law (ORS 279A–C).
- **Finance:** The board may adopt a budget, levy taxes (within voter-approved limits), issue bonds (with voter approval), and manage district funds.
- **Curriculum and instruction:** The board may establish educational programs, adopt curriculum, and set instructional policies, subject to minimum state standards.
- **Student discipline:** The board may establish and enforce student conduct policies, including suspension, expulsion, and alternative discipline programs.
- **Transportation:** The board may provide transportation services for students.
- **Intergovernmental agreements:** The board may enter into agreements with other districts, ESDs, community colleges, and government agencies.

**What the board cannot do:**

- Act outside the scope of authority granted by ORS Chapter 332 or other statutes
- Delegate certain non-delegable duties (such as adoption of the budget or hiring/firing the superintendent)
- Override state or federal law through local policy
- Take binding action without a quorum present and a proper vote
- Conduct business in meetings that violate the Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610–192.695)

> **💡 Tip:** When confronted with an unfamiliar request or proposal, always ask: "What is the statutory authority for this action?" If your board attorney or superintendent cannot point to a specific provision in ORS 332 or another statute, proceed with caution.

### ORS 332.075 — Duties of the Board

While ORS 332.045 addresses what the board *may* do, ORS 332.075 addresses what the board *must* do. These are mandatory, non-discretionary obligations.

**Key mandatory duties include:**

- **Adopt and maintain a budget** in compliance with Oregon Local Budget Law (ORS 294)
- **Provide for the education of students** within the district, ensuring access to the educational program required by state standards
- **Hire a superintendent** (or district administrator) to manage the day-to-day operations of the district
- **Maintain adequate records** including minutes, financial records, student records, and personnel files
- **Ensure compliance** with all applicable state and federal laws, including civil rights, special education (IDEA), health and safety, and labor law
- **Adopt policies** that implement state requirements, including policies on harassment, bullying, student discipline, emergency procedures, and equity
- **Report to ODE** as required, including financial reporting, student data, and compliance certifications

Failure to fulfill these mandatory duties can result in consequences ranging from audit findings to state intervention under ORS 327.103 (state corrective action authority).

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** New board members sometimes assume that policy adoption is a one-time task. In reality, ORS 332.075 requires ongoing policy maintenance — boards must regularly review and update policies to reflect changes in law, regulation, and district needs. Many districts use a policy service (such as OSBA Policy Services) to stay current.

---

### ORS 332.107 — The Superintendent Relationship

ORS 332.107 establishes the superintendent as the chief executive officer of the district, hired by and accountable to the board. This section is critical because it defines the dividing line between *governance* (the board's role) and *management* (the superintendent's role).

**Key provisions:**
- The board **hires** the superintendent by contract
- The board **evaluates** the superintendent's performance at least annually
- The board may **terminate** the superintendent's contract, subject to the terms of the contract and applicable employment law
- The superintendent is responsible for the **day-to-day management** of the district, including hiring and supervising staff, implementing board policies, and managing operations

**The governance-management boundary:**

| Board (Governance) | Superintendent (Management) |
|---|---|
| Sets the vision and strategic direction | Implements the strategic plan |
| Adopts policies | Develops administrative procedures to implement policies |
| Approves the budget | Prepares the budget recommendation |
| Hires and evaluates the superintendent | Hires and evaluates all other staff |
| Makes final decisions on appeals (e.g., expulsions) | Manages discipline process at building level |
| Represents the district to the community | Manages daily district operations |

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Individual board members sometimes attempt to direct staff members other than the superintendent — calling principals to request actions, emailing teachers about curriculum concerns, or instructing the business manager to change budget items. This violates the governance-management boundary. The board speaks as a body, and the superintendent is the board's single point of management contact.

**Practical scenario:**

*A parent contacts Board Member Kim about a teacher's grading policy. Board Member Kim should not contact the teacher or principal directly. Instead, Kim should refer the parent to the building principal or superintendent, and — if the issue reflects a broader policy concern — raise it at a board meeting for discussion as a governance matter.*

### ORS 332.155 — School Year and Calendar

ORS 332.155 grants the board authority to establish the school calendar, including the start and end dates of the school year, holiday schedules, and in-service days. However, this authority is subject to several constraints:

- **Minimum instructional time:** The calendar must provide at least the minimum number of instructional hours required by OAR 581-022-2320 (currently 900 hours for grades 1–8 and 990 hours for grades 9–12, though recent legislative changes may adjust these figures)
- **Bargaining obligations:** In districts with collectively bargained contracts, the school calendar is typically a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORS 243.650–243.782 (Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act)
- **Community input:** While not legally required in all cases, best practice is to seek community and staff input on calendar decisions, particularly regarding start dates, holiday breaks, and early-release schedules

> **💡 Tip:** Calendar decisions are among the most publicly visible actions a board takes. Start your calendar planning process early, involve stakeholders, and communicate the rationale for your decisions clearly.

---

### ORS 332.172 — Transportation

ORS 332.172 authorizes the board to provide transportation for students, including both regular routes and transportation for extracurricular activities, field trips, and special programs. While the statute grants the power to provide transportation, it does not generally mandate it — the board exercises discretion in determining the scope and extent of transportation services.

**Key considerations:**
- **State reimbursement:** The state partially reimburses transportation costs through the State School Fund, but reimbursement formulas do not cover all costs. The board must budget for the local share.
- **Safety standards:** District transportation must comply with OAR rules on bus safety, driver qualifications, and vehicle maintenance (OAR 581-053).
- **Special education:** Under federal law (IDEA) and state law (ORS 343), transportation may be a required related service for students with disabilities. This is not discretionary — if a student's IEP requires transportation, the district must provide it.
- **Homeless students:** Under the McKinney-Vento Act and Oregon law, districts must provide transportation for homeless students to their school of origin, even if the student has moved outside the district's boundaries.

---

### ORS 332.208 — Budget and Financial Authority

ORS 332.208, read in conjunction with Oregon Local Budget Law (ORS 294), establishes the board's authority over district finances. The board is the ultimate fiscal authority for the district — no funds may be spent, no budget may be adopted, and no financial obligation may be incurred without board action.

**Key financial powers and responsibilities:**

- **Budget adoption:** The board adopts the annual budget following the process prescribed by ORS 294, which includes the formation of a budget committee, public hearings, and a formal adoption vote
- **Tax levy:** The board certifies the district's property tax levy to the county assessor, within the limits established by Measure 5 (constitutional rate limit) and Measure 50 (assessed value growth limit)
- **Bonds:** The board may place a bond measure on the ballot for voter approval to fund capital construction and improvements. Bonds are subject to constitutional debt limits.
- **Supplemental budgets:** If circumstances change during the fiscal year, the board may adopt a supplemental budget under ORS 294.480
- **Financial oversight:** The board must ensure that annual audits are conducted and submitted to the Secretary of State's Division of Audits

**The budget committee:**

Oregon law requires districts to establish a budget committee composed of all board members plus an equal number of appointed community members. The budget committee reviews the superintendent's proposed budget, holds public hearings, and approves a budget that goes to the full board for final adoption. This structure ensures community participation in the district's most consequential financial decisions.

> **⚠️ Common Mistake:** Board members sometimes treat the budget as the superintendent's document that the board merely rubber-stamps. The budget is the board's most important policy document — it translates priorities into resources. Engage deeply with the budget, ask detailed questions, and ensure that the budget aligns with the district's strategic plan.

---

### Student-Related Authority

ORS Chapter 332 grants the board several important powers related to students, including:

**Attendance boundaries (ORS 332.175):** The board establishes attendance area boundaries within the district. Boundary decisions affect which school a student attends and can have significant equity implications. Boundary changes require public notice and are often contentious.

**Student discipline (ORS 332.045, ORS 339.240–339.260):** The board adopts the student conduct code and policies governing suspension, expulsion, and alternative discipline. Expulsion decisions (beyond one calendar year) typically require board action. Due process requirements under both state and federal law apply.

**Dress codes (ORS 332.045, ORS 339.655):** The board may adopt dress code policies, provided they do not violate students' constitutional rights to free expression. Oregon law also limits the ability to enforce dress codes in ways that discriminate based on gender identity or cultural expression.

**Interscholastic activities (ORS 332.075, ORS 339.430–339.460):** The board may set eligibility standards for extracurricular activities and enter into agreements with the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) for interscholastic athletics.

---

### Intergovernmental Agreements and ESDs

Oregon school districts rarely operate in isolation. ORS Chapter 332 and related statutes provide for several types of intergovernmental cooperation:

**Education Service Districts (ESDs):** ESDs are regional entities authorized under ORS 334 that provide support services to component school districts, including special education, technology, professional development, and cooperative purchasing. The board's relationship with its ESD is governed by both ORS 332 and ORS 334.

**Intergovernmental agreements (ORS 332.435, ORS 190):** School boards may enter into agreements with other public bodies — including cities, counties, other school districts, community colleges, and state agencies — for shared services, joint programs, and cooperative ventures. Common examples include shared food service, joint use of facilities, and cooperative purchasing agreements.

**Community college partnerships (ORS 332, ORS 344):** Districts may partner with community colleges to offer dual-credit programs, career-technical education (CTE), and other collaborative programs. These partnerships require formal agreements approved by both boards.

> **💡 Tip:** Intergovernmental agreements can save significant resources and expand student opportunities. When evaluating an IGA, consider the financial terms, the governance structure, the duration, and the exit provisions. Always have your board attorney review the agreement before approval.

### How ORS 332 Interacts with Other Key Statutes

ORS Chapter 332 does not exist in a vacuum. It intersects with multiple other chapters of Oregon law, and a competent board member needs at least a working familiarity with these related statutes:

| Related Statute | Subject | How It Connects to ORS 332 |
|---|---|---|
| ORS 192 (Public Records / Public Meetings) | Transparency and open government | Board meetings must comply with ORS 192.610–192.695 (Public Meetings Law). Board records are subject to ORS 192.311–192.478 (Public Records Law). |
| ORS 243 (Public Employee Relations) | Collective bargaining | Board employment authority under ORS 332 is subject to collective bargaining obligations under ORS 243.650–243.782 (PECBA). The board bargains with employee unions and ratifies contracts. |
| ORS 339 (Education — Students) | Student rights and discipline | Board disciplinary authority under ORS 332 must comply with student due process rights in ORS 339. Compulsory attendance, student transfers, and homeless student protections are in ORS 339. |
| ORS 294 (Local Budget Law) | Budgeting and finance | Board financial authority under ORS 332.208 must follow the detailed budget process in ORS 294, including the budget committee requirement and public hearing mandates. |
| ORS 244 (Government Ethics) | Conflicts of interest | Board members are public officials subject to ORS 244 ethics requirements, including conflict of interest disclosure, gift limits, and financial disclosure. |
| ORS 334 (Education Service Districts) | ESD governance | The board's relationship with its regional ESD is governed by ORS 334. ESD services, governance, and funding interact directly with district board decisions. |
| ORS 344 (Community Colleges) | Higher education partnerships | Dual-credit programs and CTE partnerships between school districts and community colleges are authorized under ORS 344 and governed in part by ORS 332 board powers. |

### Practical Scenarios: "What Does the Board Do When…"

**Scenario 1: A board member moves out of the district.**

When a board member ceases to reside within the district (or within their zone, in a zone-election district), the seat becomes vacant under ORS 332.030. The board chair should confirm the facts, seek legal counsel if the member disputes the residency change, and initiate the 30-day appointment process. The departing member may not continue to vote or participate as a board member after the vacancy is established.

**Scenario 2: The superintendent recommends hiring a new principal, but two board members oppose the hire.**

Under ORS 332.107, the superintendent is responsible for hiring all staff below the superintendent level. The board's role is to hire and evaluate the superintendent — not to hire individual administrators. Unless your board's policy specifically requires board approval of administrator hires (which is unusual and not recommended), the two dissenting board members should raise their concerns through the superintendent evaluation process, not by attempting to veto individual personnel decisions.

**Scenario 3: A community group asks the board to adopt a policy not addressed in state law.**

Under ORS 332.045, the board may adopt policies for the governance of the district, provided they do not conflict with state or federal law. The board should direct the superintendent to research the proposal, consult with legal counsel on whether the proposed policy conflicts with any existing law, and bring a recommendation to the board. If the policy is within the board's authority and does not conflict with law, the board may adopt it.

**Scenario 4: The board wants to sell a district-owned building.**

The board has authority to dispose of surplus property under ORS 332.155 and ORS 271.300–271.360 (disposition of public property). The process typically requires a board resolution declaring the property surplus, an appraisal, public notice, and — in many cases — an opportunity for other public entities to acquire the property before it is offered for private sale. Consult your board attorney before initiating any property disposal.

**Scenario 5: Three of your five board members cannot attend the next meeting.**

Without three members present, you do not have a quorum (ORS 332.045). The meeting must be cancelled or rescheduled. No official business can be conducted — no votes, no approvals, no policy actions. The two members present may meet informally, but they may not take any binding action and must be cautious about creating the appearance of a "serial meeting" under the Public Meetings Law.

### Key Takeaways for New Board Members

1. **ORS 332 is your operating manual.** Every action you take as a board member should be traceable to a specific statutory authority. If you cannot identify the authority, pause and consult your board attorney or OSBA.

2. **The 30-day vacancy rule is a hard deadline.** Missing it transfers your appointment authority to the ESD. Put the date on your calendar the moment a vacancy occurs.

3. **The board governs; the superintendent manages.** ORS 332.107 draws this line clearly. Respect it consistently, even when individual situations tempt you to cross it.

4. **Board authority has limits.** Under Dillon's Rule, you have only those powers granted by statute. When in doubt, the answer is "we probably cannot do that" until confirmed otherwise.

5. **ORS 332 does not stand alone.** Budget law (ORS 294), public meetings law (ORS 192), labor law (ORS 243), and student rights law (ORS 339) all intersect with your Chapter 332 authority. Effective governance requires at least a working familiarity with each.

6. **Policy is a living process.** Your duty to adopt and maintain policies under ORS 332.075 is ongoing — not a one-time task. Subscribe to OSBA policy updates and schedule regular policy review on your board calendar.

> **💡 Tip:** Keep a printed or bookmarked copy of ORS Chapter 332 accessible at all times. When a governance question arises — and it will, often at inconvenient moments — your first instinct should be to look at the statute. Over time, you will develop an intuition for where to find the relevant provision, and that fluency will make you a more confident and effective board member.
