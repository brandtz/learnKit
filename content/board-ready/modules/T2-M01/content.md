## Overview

Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 332 is the foundational legal framework governing the creation, organization, and operation of school boards throughout the state of Oregon. Every school board member in Oregon — whether elected or appointed — operates within the authority and constraints established by this chapter. Understanding ORS 332 is not merely a legal formality; it is the starting point for effective, lawful governance.

Chapter 332 addresses the full lifecycle of school board operations: how boards are formed, how members are elected and seated, how vacancies are filled, what powers the board holds, and how meetings must be conducted. For a new board member, this statute answers the most fundamental question in public governance: *What am I legally authorized to do, and what are the boundaries of that authority?*

The statute also establishes the procedural guardrails that protect both the board and the public. Meeting notice requirements, quorum rules, and voting procedures are all codified in ORS 332, ensuring that board actions are transparent, lawful, and subject to public accountability. Familiarity with these provisions helps board members avoid procedural missteps that could expose the district to legal challenges or undermine public trust.

For board members joining through the appointment process — such as filling a mid-term vacancy — ORS 332 is especially relevant. The statute defines the timeline and process for filling vacancies, the duration of an appointed member's service, and the transition to the next regular election cycle. Understanding these provisions ensures that appointed members are clear about their role, their authority, and the expectations placed on them from day one.

## Key Concepts

### Board Composition and Election Requirements

Oregon school boards are composed of elected members who serve defined terms as established by ORS 332. The statute specifies the number of board positions, the process for elections, and the qualifications required for service. Board members must reside within the district's boundaries and are elected by the voters of the district during regular elections. The structure ensures that the board reflects the community it serves and that transitions in membership follow a predictable, lawful process. Understanding the election cycle and term structure is essential for board continuity and succession planning.

### Quorum and Voting Rules Under State Law

A quorum — the minimum number of members who must be present to conduct official business — is defined by ORS 332 and is essential to the legal validity of any board action. Without a quorum, the board cannot vote, adopt policy, or take binding action. The statute also governs how votes are conducted, including requirements for roll-call votes on certain actions and the recording of votes in official minutes. Board members should understand that abstentions and absences affect quorum calculations and can impact the board's ability to act.

### Meeting Notice Requirements

ORS 332, in conjunction with Oregon's Public Meeting Law, requires that all regular and special meetings of the board be properly noticed to the public. Notice requirements include the time, place, and agenda of the meeting, and must be provided with sufficient advance time to allow meaningful public participation. Failure to comply with notice requirements can result in actions taken at a meeting being challenged or voided. These requirements reflect Oregon's strong commitment to open, transparent government.

### Board Authority and Legal Limitations

The authority of an Oregon school board is not unlimited — it is defined and bounded by statute. ORS 332 grants boards specific powers related to governance, finance, personnel, and policy, but boards may not act beyond what is explicitly authorized or reasonably implied by law. This principle, sometimes called the "Dillon's Rule" framework, means that if a power is not granted by statute, the board does not possess it. Understanding this boundary is critical for avoiding ultra vires (beyond authority) actions that could be legally challenged.

### Vacancy Provisions

When a board seat becomes vacant — whether through resignation, death, disqualification, or other cause — ORS 332 establishes a clear process for filling the position. The remaining board members appoint a replacement, who then serves until the next regular school board election. The statute sets a timeline within which the vacancy must be filled, ensuring that the board maintains its full complement and can continue to govern effectively. For members appointed to fill a vacancy, this provision defines both the scope and the duration of their service, making it directly relevant to anyone joining the board outside of a regular election cycle.
